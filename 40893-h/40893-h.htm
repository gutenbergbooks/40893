<h2><a name="THE_CAREER" id="THE_CAREER">THE CAREER
OF KATHERINE BUSH</a><br /><br /></h2>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>


<p>Dusk was coming on when Katherine Bush left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[Pg 1]</a></span>
the office of the Jew money lenders, Livingstone
and Devereux, in Holles Street. Theirs was
a modest establishment with no indication upon the
wire blind of the only street window as to the trade
practised by the two owners of the aristocratic names
emblazoned upon the dingy transparency. But it was
very well known all the same to numerous young bloods
who often sought temporary relief within its doors.</p>

<p>Katherine Bush had been the shorthand typist there
since she was nineteen. They paid her well, and she
had the whole of Saturday to herself.</p>

<p>She sat clicking at her machine most of the day, behind
a half-high glass screen, and when she lifted her
head, she could see those who came to the desk beyond&mdash;she
could hear their voices, and if she listened very
carefully, she could distinguish the words they said.
In the three years in which she had earned thirty shillings
a week sitting there, she had become quite a connoisseur
in male voices, and had made numerous deductions
therefrom. "Liv" and "Dev," as Mr. Percival
Livingstone and Mr. Benjamin Devereux, were called
with undue familiarity by their subordinates, often wondered
how Katherine Bush seemed to know exactly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
suitable sort of letter to write to each client, without
being told. She was certainly a most valuable young
woman, and worth the rise the firm meant to offer her
shortly.</p>

<p>She hardly ever spoke, and when she did raise her
sullen greyish-green eyes with a question in them, you
were wiser to answer it without too much palaver. The
eyes were darkly heavily lashed and were compelling
and disconcertingly steady, and set like Greek eyes
under broad brows. Her cheeks were flat, and her nose
straight, and her mouth was full and large and red.</p>

<p>For the rest she was a colourless creature, with a mop
of ashen-hued hair which gleamed with silvery lights.
She was tall and slight, and she could at any moment
have been turned by a clever dressmaker and hairdresser
into a great beauty. But as it was, she gave no thought
to her appearance, and looked unremarkable and ordinary
and lower middle-class.</p>

<p>She had wonderful hands&mdash;Where they came from
the good God alone knew! with their whiteness and
their shape. They were strong, too, and perhaps appeared
boyish rather than feminine. She did not inherit
them from that excellent mother, retired to a
better world some ten years before; nor from that
astute auctioneer father, who, dying suddenly, had left
that comfortable red-brick semi-detached villa at
Bindon's Green, Brixton, as a permanent home for his
large family.</p>

<p>But from whence come souls and bodies and hands
and eyes?&mdash;and whither do they go?&mdash;Katherine Bush
often asked herself questions like these, and plodded on
until she could give herself some kind of answer.</p>

<p>Not one single moment of her conscious hours had
ever been wasted. She was always learning something,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
and before she had reached sixteen, she had realised
that power to rule will eventually be in the grasp of the
man or woman who can reap the benefit of lessons.</p>

<p>She had enjoyed her work at the night schools, and
the wet Sundays, curled up with a book in the armchair
in the tiny attic, which she preferred to a larger
bedroom, because she could have it alone unshared with
a sister.</p>

<p>Her mind had become a storehouse of miscellaneous
English literature, a good deal mispronounced in the
words, because she had never heard it read aloud by a
cultivated voice. She knew French grammatically, but
her accent would have made a delicate ear wince. Her
own voice was singularly refined; it was not for nothing
that she had diligently listened to the voices of impecunious
aristocrats for over three years!</p>

<p>For the moment, Katherine Bush was in love. Lord
Algy had happened to glance over the glass screen upon
his first visit to Liv and Dev to be accommodated with
a thousand pounds, and his attractive blue eyes had
met the grey-green ones.</p>

<p>He had spoken to her when she came out to luncheon.
But he had done it really intelligently, and Katherine
was not insulted. Indeed, accustomed as she was to
weigh everything in life, she accorded him a mead of
praise for the manner in which he had carried out his
intention to make her acquaintance. She had flouted
him and turned him more or less inside out for over a
month, but she had let him give her lunch&mdash;and now
she had decided to spend the Saturday to Monday with
him.</p>

<p>For the scheme of existence which she had planned
out for herself, she decided her experience must be more
complete. One must see life, she argued, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
better to make a first plunge with a person of refinement,
who knew the whole game, than with one of her
own class who would be but a very sorry instructor.</p>

<p>Heavens! To spend a Saturday to Monday with
the counterpart of her brothers Fred and Bert! The
idea made her shudder. She disliked them and their
friends enough as it was&mdash;and the idea of marriage in
that circle never entered her level head. Of what use
would be all her studies, and the lessons she had
mastered, if she buried herself forever at Brixton
with Charlie Prodgers or at Clapham with Percy
Watson?</p>

<p>At this stage no moral questions troubled her at all,
nor had she begun really to apply the laws of cause
and effect in their full measure&mdash;although she was quite
aware that what she proposed to do was the last thing
she would have considered wise or safe for another
woman to attempt. Rules of conduct were wisely made
for communities she felt, and must be kept or disaster
must inevitably follow. But in her own case she was
willing to take risks, thoroughly believing in her own
cool discrimination.</p>

<p>The outlook for her should always be vast.</p>

<p>Lord Algy was passionately devoted, and it was wiser
early in life to know the nature of men. Thus she
argued to herself, being totally unaware that her point
of view was altogether affected because her heart and
her senses pleaded hard, being touched for the first time
in her twenty-two years.</p>

<p>She was quite untroubled by what the world calls
morality&mdash;and she had no scruples. These were for a
later date in her career.</p>

<p>The path looked clear and full of roses.</p>

<p>She had not been in the habit of consulting her family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
as to her movements, and had many times gone by herself
for holidays to the seaside. No questions would
be asked her when she returned on the Monday. If the
matter could have created scandal, she would not have
gone&mdash;to create scandal was not at all part of her
game.</p>

<p>Lord Algy had arranged to take her to Paris by
that Friday night's train. They would have all Saturday
and Sunday, and then return on Monday night.
Liv and Dev had granted her a holiday until the Tuesday.
She had put on her best blue serge suit that
morning, and had taken a small valise with what she
considered necessary things. And now her heart beat
rather fast as she turned into Oxford Street in the
gathering October dusk.</p>

<p>For a few moments she wondered what it would have
been like if she had been going to marry Lord Algy&mdash;before
all the world. Quite a great pleasure no doubt
for a month or two&mdash;But then?&mdash;He was the fourth son
of a stingy Welsh marquis, and nothing would ever induce
his family to pardon such a m&eacute;salliance. Of this
she was well aware. It was the business of "Liv" and
"Dev" to make themselves acquainted with a good deal
about the peerage, and whatever her employers knew,
Katherine Bush knew.</p>

<p>Life for her held no illusions. Her studies had convinced
her that to be strong and perfectly honest were
the only two things of any avail, and to acquire a thorough
knowledge of human beings, so as then to be able
to manipulate these pawns.</p>

<p>Lord Algy she believed was only a most agreeable
part of her education, but of no vital importance. She
would have been horrified if anyone had told her that
she was mixing up sentiment in the affair!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>To get everything down to its bedrock meaning had
been her endeavour, ever since she had first read Darwin
and Herbert Spencer.</p>

<p>"I shall have the experience of a widow," she said to
herself, "and can then decide what is next to be
done."</p>

<p>Lord Algy was a Guardsman&mdash;and knew, among
other things, exactly how to spend an agreeable Saturday
to Monday! He was piqued by Katherine Bush,
and almost in love. He looked forward to his brief
honeymoon with delight.</p>

<p>He was waiting for her in a taxicab at the corner of
Oxford Circus, and when she got in with her little
valise, he caught and kissed her hand.</p>

<p>"We will go and dine at the Great Terminus," he
told her in his charming voice, "and don't you think
it would be much nicer if we stayed there to-night, and
went on by the morning train?&mdash;It is such a miserable
hour to arrive in Paris otherwise&mdash;you would be
knocked up for the day."</p>

<p>He was holding her hand, and the nearness of him
thrilled her, in some new and delicious way. She hesitated,
though, for a moment&mdash;she never acted on impulse.
She crushed down a strange sensation of gasp
which came in her throat. After all, of what matter
if she stayed&mdash;or started to-night?&mdash;since she had already
cast the die, and did not mean to shirk the payment
of the stakes.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said, quite low.</p>

<p>"I hoped you would agree, pet," he whispered, encircling
her with his arm, "I meant to persuade you,
and I am going to make you so awfully happy&mdash;I sent
my servant this afternoon to take the rooms for us,
and everything will be ready."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>This sounded agreeable enough, and Katherine Bush
permitted herself to smile, which was a rare occurrence;
she would spend hours and days without the flicker of
one coming near her red lips.</p>

<p>In the uncertain light, Lord Algy felt it more than
he actually saw it, and it warmed him. She was, as
he had confessed to his best friend in the battalion, an
enigma to him&mdash;hence her charm.</p>

<p>"She treats me as though I were the ground under
her feet at times," he recounted to Jack Kilcourcy. "I
don't think she cares two damned straws for me really,
but, by Jove! she is worth while! She has no nonsense
about her, and she is so awfully game!"</p>

<p>He had taken good care never to let Jack see her,
though&mdash;or tell him her name!</p>

<p>It was not long before they reached the hotel, and
Katherine Bush was a little angry with herself because
she felt a quiver of nervousness when they were in the
big hall.</p>

<p>Lord Algy knew all the ropes, and his air of complete
insouciance reassured her. A discreet valet
stepped forward and spoke to his master, and they were
soon in the lift, and so to a well-lighted and warmed
suite.</p>

<p>"These colours and this imitation Chippendale are
rather awful, aren't they," Lord Algy said, looking
round, "but we must not mind, as it is only for one
night; the Palatial in Paris will be different&mdash;I am glad
Hanson saw to the flowers."</p>

<p>Huge bunches of roses stood upon the table and
mantelpiece. Katherine Bush thought it a splendid
place, but if it appeared rather "awful" to him, she
must not show her admiration.</p>

<p>"Tea will come in a moment&mdash;I mean chocolate, pet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>&mdash;and
I think we shall be as jolly as can be. In there
is your room; they will have brought up your valise by
now, I expect."</p>

<p>Katherine Bush moved forward and went through the
door. A cheery fire was burning, and the curtains were
drawn, and on a chair there was a big cardboard box.
She looked at it, it was addressed "Mrs. Rufus."</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;is that&mdash;?&mdash;and what is it for?" she asked,
in a voice deep as a well.</p>

<p>"It is just a fur-lined coat, darling," Lord Algy answered,
as he pulled undone the string, "and a little
wrap&mdash;I thought you would be so awfully cold on the
boat&mdash;and probably would not have been able to bring
much luggage."</p>

<p>A slight flush came into the young woman's white
cheeks, something in her loathed taking presents.</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully&mdash;I'll be glad to have you lend them
to me for this trip&mdash;but why is it addressed 'Mrs.
Rufus'?&mdash;Mr. Devereux has got a sister of that
name."</p>

<p>Lord Algy laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, I could not have it 'Fitz-Rufus,' because
every one knows that is the Merioneth name, given
us poor devils by the Normans, because we were such a
red-headed lot, and I bet they found our own too difficult
to pronounce!" He began pulling out the coat and
a soft pink silk dressing-gown from the box. "I always
am just 'Rufus' when I come out like this." He laughed
again a little constrainedly; it had just struck him that
the latter part of his sentence was perhaps not very
felicitously expressed&mdash;since he knew Katherine Bush
was no chorus lady, accustomed to temporary wedded
appellations!</p>

<p>She looked him straight in the eyes with her strange,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
disconcertingly steady grey-green ones&mdash;and then she
smiled again&mdash;as the Sphinx might have done before
being set in eternal immobility of stone.</p>

<p>Lord Algy felt stupidly uncomfortable, so he folded
her in his arms with a fond caress, a far better plan
he had always found than any argument or explanation
with women.</p>

<p>Katherine Bush realised the joy of it. She was ready
for every grade of pleasure as well as experience. This
was how things were done in Lord Algy's world, then&mdash;So
be it.</p>

<p>Together they looked at the coat and wrap, and he
helped her to take off her hat and jacket, and try them
on. They were very friendly, and Lord Algy suggested
that as the dressing-gown was almost a teagown and
was fairly pretty, she might wear it for dinner, which
they would have in the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"You'll look sweet in pink, darling," he lisped, as he
kissed her ear, "and it will be so soft and cosy."</p>

<p>Then the waiter knocked at the door and said the
chocolate was ready, so they went back to the sitting
room.</p>

<p>He was quite adorable as he assisted her to pour in
the cream&mdash;but Katherine Bush now decided she would
keep him at arm's length for a while; the game was
really so entertaining, and its moves must be made to
last as long as possible.</p>

<p>Lord Algy enjoyed fencing, too, so they talked in a
more matter-of-fact way for an hour or more, and then
she told him she would go and change for dinner, as it
would be ready in twenty minutes.</p>

<p>"I'll have to be your maid, darling&mdash;I make an
awfully good maid&mdash;I never bungle with the beastly
hooks&mdash;and I should love to brush your hair!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>His eyes shone with light-hearted passion, and his
good-looking face was close to her own.</p>

<p>"You shall perhaps&mdash;to-morrow," Katherine Bush
retorted&mdash;and slipping into the room beyond she shut
the door.</p>

<p>Lord Algy flung himself into an armchair, lit a
cigarette and laughed softly. He had never had such
an experience as this.</p>

<p>"She is a wonder!" he said to himself. "Astonishing
for her class&mdash;for any class&mdash;She reminds me of some
French heroine&mdash;what's her name&mdash;fellow wrote jolly
nice stuff&mdash;oh&mdash;er&mdash;<i>Mademoiselle de Maupin</i>, of
course! By Jove! I believe I am going to have a time
like that chap had&mdash;only she won't go off into limbo on
Monday night!&mdash;Confound it, I believe I'm in
love!"</p>

<p>Then he threw away his cigarette end, and went
round through the outer passage to his room beyond
hers, where he found his servant turning on his bath in
the bathroom which divided their apartments.</p>

<p>"Madame did not seem to require it&mdash;yet," Hanson
said respectfully, "so I have turned on Your Lordship's
first."</p>

<p>And in a few minutes Lord Algy was splashing in
the Lubin scented water, while he gaily whistled a tune.</p>

<p>And Katherine Bush heard him as she was sponging
her white face&mdash;and stopped and listened surprisedly.</p>

<p>"Whatever can he be having a bath for at this time
of day," she said to herself, "and it is not Saturday!"</p>

<p>Then the thought came, it might be the custom of
his class to bathe before dinner! A scarlet spot grew
in each cheek&mdash;she must never forget to learn and profit
by her lessons, so she deliberately went and knocked on
the communicating door and called out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Algy! you are mean to take the first!&mdash;When you
have finished, turn on mine."</p>

<p>And then she stood and trembled for a minute, while
she piled up her great mass of ashen hair.</p>

<p>"All right, darling!" he called back. "Only I must
have my reward!"</p>

<p>"When <i>I</i> please!" the young woman said to herself.
"And not until."</p>

<p>At dinner, she looked quite pretty, the pink suited
her pale skin, and the unusual feminine fluffiness of the
garment altered her rather stern appearance. She had
not yet begun to employ any art whatever, or to alter
the rough bundling up of her hair, but now, out to
enjoy herself under the most propitious and rose-coloured
circumstances, her strange, sullen eyes shone with
a subtle fascination, and her deep voice had tones in it
which seduced the ear.</p>

<p>She had never dined with him before, only lunched,
and now it behooved her to observe the ways of things,
as she was quite ignorant of the art of dining out. Mr.
Benjamin Devereux had made advances to her in her
first year at Liv and Dev, but she had annihilated him,
and withered his proposals for unlimited dinners and a
generous settlement with scorn. There had never been
a moment when she had contemplated her charms being
wasted upon anything but an aristocrat, from whom
she could acquire "tone."</p>

<p>No denizen of Bindon's Green&mdash;no friend of the family&mdash;no
companion in the morning train had ever had
so much as a kind word, much less the tip of one of her
strong white fingers. She was as a bunch of grapes
with perfect bloom retained.</p>

<p>She was taking in every line of Lord Algy as she sat
there sipping her soup. She had refused oysters, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
had watched him as he devoured his with the joy of an
epicure. She had not been quite certain as to which
was the right implement to employ. She supposed it
was that little fork with the three prongs&mdash;but she determined
to make no mistakes.</p>

<p>It was easy enough to gobble oysters soused in
vinegar and red pepper, with huge slices of bread and
butter, and a bottle of stout, as her brother Fred was
wont to enjoy them at supper on Saturday nights. Or
they could be pulled about in the mincing fashion in
which his fianc&eacute;e, that genteel Mabel Cawber, treated
them, with little finger daintily curved, and the first
and the thumb only in use! but before she, Katherine
Bush, swallowed one, she would ascertain exactly how
they were eaten in Lord Algy's world! No good out of
this trip should be wasted.</p>

<p>As dinner advanced, he began to make more ardent
love to her&mdash;and the champagne elevated both their
spirits. He reproached her for her hardness in not
having allowed him to play the part of maid, after all.
She was a capricious little darling, but surely did not
mean to go on being unkind?</p>

<p>No; she did not&mdash;but she had suddenly realised, while
dressing, that some of her garments were not fine enough
for the situation, and must be kept out of sight!</p>

<p>She did not tell him this, however, but continued to
enact the r&ocirc;le of condescending queen, while quietly she
watched him as a cat watches a mouse.</p>

<p>She loved the way his hair was brushed&mdash;how different
from Charlie Prodgers!&mdash;she loved the finely cut
back of his head. She was perfectly aware that he
showed outwardly every mark of breeding in his weak,
handsome face, and lean well-drilled figure. These things
pleased her&mdash;especially the breeding; it was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
very far from what she ever saw at Bindon's Green!</p>

<p>Lord Algy had the easy, pleasant manner of his kind,
with a strong personal attraction, amply balancing absence
of brain for general purposes, and he was versed
in every art for the cajoling of women.</p>

<p>The dinner grew more and more agreeable, until when
coffee and liqueurs came, Katherine Bush felt exalted
into a strange heaven. She had analysed almost all emotions
in the abstract, but not their possible effects upon
herself. She found the ones she was experiencing now
peculiarly delightful! To be twenty-two and in love
for the first time in life, with an extremely delectable
specimen of manhood&mdash;to be free as air&mdash;answerable to
no one&mdash;untroubled by backward or forward thoughts,
unworried by tormenting speculations as to whether the
affair was right or wrong&mdash;wise or unwise&mdash;This was
a state of things which made the cup worth drinking,
and Katherine Bush knew it.</p>

<p>No possibility of bitter dregs to follow the last sip
entered her calculations.</p>

<p>The imp gods laughed, no doubt, and Lord Algy's
blue eyes were full of passionate delight!</p>

<p>Thus with all things <i>couleur de rose</i>, Katherine Bush
began her brief honeymoon.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>


<p>"And I shall not see you for a whole month, my
precious pet!" Lord Algy whispered, as the
train was approaching Charing Cross, at about
eleven o'clock on the Monday night of the return journey.
"I don't know how I shall bear it, but you will
write every day, won't you?&mdash;Promise me, darling&mdash;&mdash;I
wish now that I had not taken first leave and arranged
to shoot with my brother-in-law next week."</p>

<p>His arm still encircled her, and her ashen-hued head
leaned against his shoulder, so that he could not see the
expression in her sombre eyes. It was that of an animal
in pain.</p>

<p>"No, I shall not write, Algy, and you must not, either&mdash;we
have had a divine time, and I shall never forget it.
But it is stupid to write&mdash;what good would it be to
either of us?"</p>

<p>He pleaded that he would not be able to live without
a word&mdash;after the three days of perfect bliss they had
enjoyed&mdash;and, of course, they would enjoy many more,
when he returned from Wales&mdash;!</p>

<p>Katherine Bush did not argue with him&mdash;of what use
since her own mind was entirely made up? She just
let him kiss her as much as he desired without speaking
a word, and then she arranged her hat and veil, and was
demurely ready to get out when the train should draw
up at the platform.</p>

<p>Lord Algy could not have been more loverlike. He
was really feeling full of emotion and awfully sorry to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
part. She had been so wonderful, he told himself. She
had enjoyed the whole thing so simply, and was such a
delightful companion. She had not asked any silly
questions or plagued him with sentimental forever-and-ever
kinds of suggestions, as lots of girls might have
done with her limited experience of these transitory
affairs. She had accepted the situation as frankly as a
savage who had never heard that there could be any
more binding unions. He really did not know how he
was going to stand a whole month of separation, but
perhaps it was just as well, as he was on the verge of
being ridiculously in love, and to plunge in, he knew,
would be a hopeless mistake. She was a thousand times
nicer and more interesting than any girl he had ever
met in his life. If she had only been a lady, and there
would not be any row about it, he could imagine any
fellow being glad to marry her.</p>

<p>She was not at all cold either&mdash;indeed, far from it&mdash;and
seemed instinctively to understand the most enchanting
passion&mdash;He thought of <i>Mademoiselle de
Maupin</i> again&mdash;and felt he had been as equally blessed
as <i>D'Albert</i>. She would make the sweetest friend for
months and months, and he would rush back from Wales
the moment he could break from his family, and seek
solace in her arms&mdash;he would have got himself in hand
again by then, so as not to do anything stupid. He
always meant to be very, very good to her, though.
Thus he dreamed, and grew more demonstrative, clasping
her once again in a fond farewell embrace, during
the last available moment, and his charming blue eyes,
with their brown curly lashes, looked half full of tears.</p>

<p>"Say you love me, darling," he commanded, wishing,
like all lovers, to hear the spoken words.</p>

<p>Katherine Bush was very pale, and there was concentrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
feeling in her face which startled him. Then she
answered, her voice deeper than usual:</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I love you, Algy&mdash;perhaps you will never
know how much. I do not suppose I will ever really
love anyone else in the same way in my life."</p>

<p>Then the train drew up at the station.</p>

<p>The people all looked unreal in the foggy October
air under the glaring lights&mdash;and the whole thing appeared
as a dream indeed when, half an hour later,
Katherine sped through the suburban roads to Bindon's
Green, alone in the taxi. Lord Algy had put her in
and paid the man liberally, and with many last love
words had bidden her good-night and&mdash;<i>au revoir</i>!</p>

<p>So this chapter was finished&mdash;she realised that. And
it had been really worth while. An outlook had opened
for her into a whole new world&mdash;where realities lived&mdash;where
new beings moved, where new standpoints could
be reached. She saw that her former life had been
swept from her&mdash;and now, to look back upon, appeared
an impossible tedium. She had mastered all the shades
of what three days of most intimate companionship with
<i>a gentleman</i> could mean, and the memory contained no
flaw. Algy's chivalry and courtesy had never faltered;
she might have been a princess or his bride, from the
homage he had paid her. Dear, much-loved Algy! Her
passion for him was tinged with almost a mother love&mdash;there
was something so tender and open-hearted about
him. But now she must take stern hold of herself, and
must have pluck enough to profit by what she had
learned of life&mdash;Though to-night she was too tired to
do more than retrospect.</p>

<p>Oh! the wonder of it all!&mdash;the wonder of love, and
the wonder of emotion! She clenched her cold hands
round the handle of her little valise. She was trembling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
She had insisted upon his keeping the fur-lined coat for
the present. How could she account for it to her family,
she had argued? But she never meant to take it
again.</p>

<p>No one was awake at Laburnum Villa when she
opened the door with her latchkey, and she crept up
to her little icy chamber under the roof, numb in mind
and body and soul&mdash;and was soon shivering between
the cotton sheets.</p>

<p>Oh! the contrast to the warm, flower-scented bedroom
at the Palatial! And once she had not known the difference
between linen and cotton!</p>

<p>She said this over to herself while she felt the nap&mdash;and
then the tears gathered in her eyes one by one, and
she sobbed uncontrollably for a while&mdash;Alas! to have to
renounce all joy&mdash;forever more!</p>

<p>She fell asleep towards morning, and woke with a
start as her alarm clock thundered. But her face was
set like marble, and there was not a trace of weakness
upon it when she appeared at the family scramble,
which did duty for breakfast.</p>

<p>There had been a row between Fred and Gladys, the
sister a year older than herself, who was a saleswoman
at a fashionable dressmaker's establishment. Matilda,
the eldest of the family, was trying to smooth
matters while she sewed up a rent in the skirt which
Ethel, the youngest, would presently wear to the school
"for young ladies" which she daily attended. This, the
most youthful Miss Bush, meanwhile sat in a very soiled
Japanese quilted dressing gown, devouring sausages.
There were bloaters on the table, too, and treacle&mdash;and
the little general servant was just bringing in the
unsavory coffee in the tin coffeepot.</p>

<p>Tea had been good enough for them always in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
father's time, and Matilda for her part could not see
why Fred had insisted upon having coffee, on the
strength of a trip to Boulogne on bank holiday.</p>

<p>But there it was! When Fred insisted, things had to
be done&mdash;even if one hated coffee!</p>

<p>Katherine Bush loathed most of her family. She had
not an expansive nature, and was quite ruthless. Why
should she love them just because they were her brothers
and sisters? She had not asked to be born among
them! They were completely uncongenial to her, and
always had been. It was obviously ridiculous and
illogical then to expect her to feel affection for them,
just because of this accident of birth, so she argued.
Matilda, the eldest, who had always been a mother to
the rest, did hold one small corner of her heart.</p>

<p>"Poor old Tild," as she called her, "the greatest old
fool living," and Matilda adored her difficult sister.</p>

<p>How doubly impossible they all appeared now to the
unveiled eyes of Katherine!</p>

<p>"This is simply disgusting stuff, this coffee!" she
said, putting her cup down with a grimace. "It is no
more like French coffee than Ett looks like a Japanese
because she has got on that dirty dressing-gown."</p>

<p>"What do you know of French coffee, I'd like to ask&mdash;What
ho!" Bert, the brother just younger than herself,
demanded, with one of his bright flashes. "Have
you been to 'Boulong for a bit of a song,' like the Gov'nor?"</p>

<p>"I wish you'd give over calling me the Gov'nor,
Bert!" Mr. Frederick Bush interposed, stopping for a
moment his bicker with Gladys. "Mabel strongly objects
to it. She says it is elderly and she dislikes slang,
anyway."</p>

<p>But Albert Bush waved half a sausage on his fork,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
and subsided into a chuckle of laughter. He was the
recognised wit of the family, and Ethel giggled in
chorus.</p>

<p>Katherine never replied to any of their remarks, unless
she wished to; there was no use in throwing down
the gauntlet to her, it remained lying there. She did
not even answer Matilda's tentative suggestion that she
had always drunk the coffee before without abusing it!</p>

<p>If they only knew how significant the word "before"
sounded to her that morning!</p>

<p>She finished her bit of burnt toast, and began putting
on her hat at a side mirror preparatory to starting.
She did not tell Gladys that she would be late if she
did not leave also; that was her sister's own affair, she
never interfered with people.</p>

<p>As she left the dining-room, she said to Matilda:</p>

<p>"I want a fire in my room when I come back this
evening, please. I'll have one every day&mdash;Make out
how much it will be, and Em'ly's extra work, and I'll
pay for it."</p>

<p>"Whatever do you want that for, Kitten?" the astonished
Matilda demanded. "Why, it is only October
yet. No one ever has a fire until November, even
in the drawing-room&mdash;let alone a bedroom. It is ridiculous,
dearie!"</p>

<p>"That aspect does not matter at all to me," Katherine
retorted. "I want it, and so I shall have it. I
have some work to do, and I am not going to freeze."</p>

<p>Matilda knew better than to continue arguing. She
had not lived with Katherine for twenty-two years for
nothing.</p>

<p>"She takes after father in a way," she sighed to herself
as she began helping the little servant to clear away
the breakfast things, when they had all departed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
West End, where it was their boast to announce that
they were all employed&mdash;they looked down upon the
City!</p>

<p>"Yes, it's father, not mother or her family; father
would have his way, and Fred has got this idea, too,
but nothing like Kitten's! How I wish she'd look at
Charlie Prodgers and get married and settled!"</p>

<p>Then she sighed again and sat down by the window to
enjoy her one great pleasure of the day, the perusal
of the <i>feuilleton</i> in the <i>Morning Reflector</i>. In these
brief moments she forgot all family worries, all sordid
cares&mdash;and revelled in the adventures of aristocratic
villains and persecuted innocent governesses and actresses,
and felt she, too, had a link with the great
world. She was a good sound Radical in what represented
politics to her, so she knew all aristocrats must
be bad, and ought to be exterminated, but she loved to
read about them, and hear first-hand descriptions of the
female members from Gladys, who saw many in the
showrooms of Madame Ermantine. "Glad <i>knows</i>,"
she often said to herself with pride.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Katherine Bush&mdash;having snubbed Mr.
Prodgers into silence in the train&mdash;where he man&oelig;uvred
to meet her every morning&mdash;reached her employers' establishment,
and began her usual typing.</p>

<p>There was work to be done by twelve o'clock in connection
with the renewal of the loan to Lord Algernon
Fitz-Rufus&mdash;the old Marquis would be obliged to
pay before Christmas time, Mr. Percival Livingstone
said.</p>

<p>Miss Bush, to his intense astonishment, gave a sudden
short laugh&mdash;it was quite mirthless and stopped
abruptly&mdash;but it was undoubtedly a laugh!</p>

<p>"What is amusing you?" he asked with a full lisp, too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
taken off his guard to be as refined and careful in tone
as usual.</p>

<p>"The old Marquis having to pay, of course," Katherine
responded.</p>

<p>Never once during the whole day did she allow her
thoughts to wander from her work, which she accomplished
with her usual precision. Even during her
luncheon hour she deliberately read the papers. She
had trained herself to do one thing at a time, and the
moment for reflection would not come until she could
be undisturbed. She would go back as soon as she was
free, to her own attic, and there think everything out,
and decide upon the next step to be taken in her game
of life.</p>

<p>A few burnt sticks, and a lump of coal in the tiny
grate, were all she discovered on her return that evening
to her sanctuary. The maid-of-all-work was not
a talented fire-lighter and objected to criticism. Katherine's
level brows met with annoyance, and she proceeded
to correct matters herself, while she muttered:</p>

<p>"Inefficient creature! and they say that we are all
equal! Why can't she do her work, then, as well as I
can mine!"</p>

<p>Her firm touch and common sense arrangement of
paper and kindling soon produced a bright blaze, and
when she had removed her outdoor things, she sat down
to think determinedly.</p>

<p>She loved Lord Algy&mdash;that was the first and most
dominant thing to face. She loved him so much that
it would never be safe to see him again, since she had
not the slightest intention of ever drifting into the position
of being a man's mistress. She had tasted of the
tree of knowledge with her eyes open, and the fruit that
she had eaten was too dangerously sweet for continuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
food. Love would obtain a mastery over her if things
went on; she knew that she might grow not to care
about anything else in the world but only Algy. Thus,
obviously, all connection with him must be broken off at
once, or her career would be at an end, and her years
of study wasted. Even if he offered to marry her she
could never take the position with a high hand. There
would always be this delicious memory of illicit joys
between them, which would unconsciously bias Algy's
valuation of her. She had learned things of consequence
which she could not have acquired in any other way, and
now she must have strength to profit by them. She
utterly despised weaklings and had no pity for lovesick
maidens. For a woman to throw over her future for a
man was to her completely contemptible. She probed
the possible consequences of her course of action unflinchingly;
she believed so in her own luck that she felt
sure that no awkward accident could happen to her.
But even if this should occur, there were ways which
could be discovered to help her&mdash;and since the moment
had not yet come, she would defer contemplating it,
but would map out her plans regardless of this contingency.
So she argued to herself.</p>

<p>She could not endure living under the family roof
of Laburnum Villa any longer, that was incontestable;
she must go out and learn exactly how the ladies of
Lord Algy's world conducted themselves. Not that
she wished to dawn once more upon his horizon as a
polished Vere de Vere&mdash;but that for her own satisfaction
she must make herself his equal in all respects.
There had been so many trifles about which she had
felt she had been ignorant, almost every moment of the
three days had given her new visions, and had shown
her her own shortcomings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"There are no bars to anything in life but stupidity
and vanity," she told herself, "and they at least shall
not stand in my way."</p>

<p>The temptation to have one more farewell interview
with him was great, but there was nothing the least
dramatic about her, so that aspect did not appeal to
her as it would have done to an ordinary woman who is
ruled by emotional love for dramatic situations; she
was merely drawn by the desire for her mate once more,
and this she knew and crushed.</p>

<p>It would mean greater pain than pleasure to her afterwards,
and would certainly spoil all chance of a career.
She gloried in the fact that she had had the
courage to taste of life's joys for experience, but she
would have burned with shame to feel that she was being
drawn into an equivocal position through her own
weakness.</p>

<p>Katherine Bush was as proud as Lucifer. She fully
understood&mdash;apart from moral questions which did not
trouble her&mdash;that what she had done would have been
fatal to a fool like Gladys, or to any girl except one
with her exceptional deliberation and iron will. She
truly believed that such experiments were extremely dangerous,
and on no account to be adopted as a principle
of action in general. The straight and narrow path of
orthodox virtue was the only one for most women to
follow; and the only one she would have advocated for
her sisters or friends. The proof being that as a rule
when women erred they invariably suffered because they
had not the pluck or the strength to know when to stop.</p>

<p>Katherine Bush was absolutely determined that she
should never be hampered, in her game, by her own emotions
or weakness.</p>

<p>Before Lord Algy would return from Wales, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
would have left Liv and Dev's. She had never given him
her home address, and there would be no trace of her.
She would look in the <i>Morning Post</i> for information,
and then endeavour to secure some post as companion or
secretary to some great lady. There she would pick up
the rest of the necessary equipment to make herself into
a person in whom no flaws could be found. And when
she had accomplished this, then fate would have opened
up some path worth following.</p>

<p>"Some day I shall be one of the greatest women in
England," she told herself, as she looked unblinking
into the glowing coals.</p>

<p>Then, having settled her plans, she allowed herself
to go over the whole of her little holiday, incident by
incident.</p>

<p>How utterly adorable Algy had been! She found
herself thrilling again at each remembrance&mdash;How refined
and how considerate! How easy were his manners;
he was too sure of himself, and his welcome in life,
ever to show the deplorable self-consciousness which
marked the friends who came on Sundays, or the bumptious
self-assertion of her brothers, Fred and Bert.</p>

<p>If only she had been born in his world, and had by
right of birth those prerogatives which she meant to
obtain by might of intelligence, how good it would have
been to marry him&mdash;for a few years! But even now in
her moment of fierce, passionate first love, which in her
case was so largely made up of the physical, her brain
was too level and speculative not to balance the pros
and cons of such a situation. And while she felt she
loved him with all her being, she knew that he was no
match for her intellectually, and that when the glamour
faded he would weary her.</p>

<p>But the wrench of present renunciation was none the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
less bitter&mdash;Never any more to feel his fond arms clasping
her&mdash;never again to hear his caressing words of
love!</p>

<p>If a coronet for her brow shone at the end of the
climb, her heart at all events must turn to ice by the
way, or so she felt at the moment.</p>

<p>He had talked so tenderly about their future meetings.
How they would go again to Paris when he returned
from Wales. How she must let him give her
pretty clothes and a diamond ring, and how she was his
darling pet, and his own girl. She knew that he was
growing really to love her; Katherine Bush never deceived
herself or attempted to throw dust in her own
eyes. She had eaten her cake and could not have it. If
she had held out and drawn him on, no doubt she could
have been his wife, but it was only for one second that
this thought agitated her. Yes, she could have been
his wife&mdash;but to what end? Only one of humiliation.
She was not yet ready to carry off such a position with
a certainty of success; she knew she was ignorant, and
that the knowledge of such ignorance would destroy
her self-confidence and leave her at the mercy of circumstance.
So all was for the best. She had not
guessed that it would be so very painful to part from
him&mdash;dear, attractive Algy! She could not sit still
any longer. A convulsion of anguish and longing shook
her, and she got up and stamped across the room. Then
she put on her outdoor things again and stalked down
into the gathering night, passionate emotion filling her
soul.</p>

<p>But when she came back an hour later, after tramping
the wet roads round the common, the battle was won.</p>

<p>And this night she fell asleep without any tears.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>


<p>It was about a fortnight later that Katherine got
Matilda to meet her at a Lyons' popular caf&eacute; for
tea on a Wednesday afternoon. Livingstone and
Devereux had given her a half holiday, being on country
business bent; and having matured her plans, and having
set fresh schemes in train, she thought she might as
well communicate them to the one sister who mattered
to her. Matilda loved an excuse to "get up to town,"
and had come in her best hat, with smiling face. Katherine
was always very generous to her, though she was
no more careless about money than she was about other
things.</p>

<p>"It is all very well, Tild," she said, in her deep voice,
after they had spoken upon indifferent subjects for a
while. "But I am tired of it. I am absolutely tired of
it, so there! I am tired of Liv and Dev&mdash;tired of the
hateful old click of the machine with no change of work&mdash;I
am tired of seeing the people of another class
through the glass screen&mdash;and I mean to get out of it."</p>

<p>"Whatever are you talking of, Kitten!" the elder
Miss Bush exclaimed, as she stirred her cocoa. "Why,
Liv and Dev's as good a berth as you'd get&mdash;thirty bob
a week, and a whole holiday on Saturday&mdash;to say nothing
of off times like this&mdash;you must be mad, dearie!"
Then something further in her sister's remark aroused
comment.</p>

<p>"And what do you mean by people of 'another class'?
Why, aren't we as good as anyone&mdash;if we had their
money?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Katherine Bush put down her empty cup before she
replied:</p>

<p>"No, we're not&mdash;and if you weren't as ignorant as
you are, dear old Tild, you'd know it. There are lots
and lots of classes above us&mdash;they mayn't be any cleverer&mdash;indeed,
they are often fools, and many aren't any
richer&mdash;but they're ladies and gentlemen."</p>

<p>Matilda felt personally insulted.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, Kitten!&mdash;If you are such a poor
thing that you don't consider yourself a young lady&mdash;I
am not. I always did say that you would pick up rubbishly
ideas bothering after those evening lectures and
French classes&mdash;instead of coming with Glad and Bert
and me to the cinema, like a decent Christian&mdash;it was
a low sort of thing to do, I think, and looked as if we'd
none of us had a proper education&mdash;and all they have
done for you is to unsettle your mind, my dear&mdash;so I
tell you."</p>

<p>Katherine Bush smiled complacently and looked at
her sister straight in the eyes in her disconcerting way,
which insured attention. Matilda knew that she would
now have to listen probably to some home truths. She
could manage Gladys very well in spite of her giggles
and irresponsibility, but she had never been able to
have the slightest influence upon Katherine from the
moment of their mother's death, years before, when
she had taken her place as head of the orphaned household.
Katherine had always been odd. She had a vile
temper as a child, and was silent and morose, and at
constant war with that bright boy Bert, loved of the
other sisters: Matilda remembered very well many scenes
when Katherine had puzzled her. She was so often
scornful and disapproving, and used to sit there with a
book scowling at them on Sundays when a rowdy friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
or two came in to tea, and never once joined in the
chorus of the comic songs they sang, while she simply
loathed the gramophone records.</p>

<p>"You say awfully silly things sometimes, Tild," Katherine
announced calmly. "There would not be any good
in my considering myself a young lady, because at my
present stage anyone who really knew would know that
I am not&mdash;but I mean to become one some day. You
can do anything with will."</p>

<p>Matilda bridled.</p>

<p>"I don't know what more of a lady you could be than
we all are&mdash;Why, Mabel Cawber always says that we are
the most refined family of the whole lot at Bindon's
Green&mdash;and Mabel ought to know surely!"</p>

<p>"Because her father was a solicitor, and she has never
done a stroke of work in her life?" Katherine smiled
again&mdash;it made Matilda feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Mabel is a perfect lady," she affirmed indignantly.</p>

<p>"I will be able to tell you about that in a year's time,
I expect," Katherine said, reflectively. "At present, I
am not experienced enough to say, but I strongly feel
that she is not. You see, Tild, you get your ideas of
things from the trash you read&mdash;and from the ridiculous
nonsense Fred and Albert talk after they come
home from those meetings at the National Brotherhood
Club&mdash;fool's stuff about the equality of all men&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course we are all equal!" broke in Matilda, still
ruffled.</p>

<p>Katherine Bush smiled again. "Well, I wish you
could see the difference between Fred and Bert and those
gentlemen I see through the glass screen! They have
all got eyes and noses and legs and arms in common, but
everything else is different, and if you knew anything
about evolution, you'd understand why."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Should I!" indignantly.</p>

<p>"Yes. It is the something inside the head, something
in the ideas, produced by hundreds of years of
different environment and a wider point of view&mdash;and it
is immensely in the little customs and manners of speech
and action. If you had ever seen and spoken to a real
gentleman, Tild, you would grasp it."</p>

<p>Matilda was quite unmollified and on the defensive.</p>

<p>"You can't have two more honourable, straightforward
young fellows than our brothers in no family in
England, and I expect lots of your gents borrowing
money are as crooked as can be!"</p>

<p>Katherine became contemplative.</p>

<p>"Probably&mdash;the thing I mean does not lie in moral
qualities&mdash;I suppose it ought to&mdash;but it doesn't&mdash;We
had a real sharp last week, and to look at and to hear
him talk he was a perfect gentleman, with refined and
easy manners; he would never have done anything in
bad taste like Fred and Bert often do."</p>

<p>"Bad taste!" snorted Matilda.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;we all do. No gentleman ever tells people in
words that he is one&mdash;Fred and Bert say it once a week,
at least. They lay the greatest stress on it. No real
gentlemen get huffy and touchy; they are too sure of
themselves and do not pretend anything, they are quite
natural and you take them as they are. They don't do
one thing at home at ease, and another when they are
dressed up, and they aren't a bit ashamed of knowing
anyone. Fred does not speak to Ernie Gibbs when he
is out with Mabel, although they were at school together!"</p>

<p>"Ernie Gibbs! Why, Kitten, he is only a foreman in
the Bindon Gas Works! Of course not! Mabel <i>would</i>
take on!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Matilda thought her sister was being too stupid!</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure she would&mdash;that is just it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And quite right, too!"</p>

<p>Katherine shrugged her shoulders. There was not
much use in arguing with Matilda, she felt, Matilda
who had never thought out any problem for herself in
her life&mdash;Matilda who had not the privilege of knowing
any attractive Lord Algys!&mdash;and who therefore could
not have grasped the immeasurable gulf that she, Katherine,
had found lay between his class and hers!</p>

<p>"They say Fred is a capable auctioneer because father
and grandfather were&mdash;you hear people saying 'it
is in the blood'&mdash;Well, why is it, Tild?&mdash;Because heredity
counts just as it does in animals, of course. So
why, if a man's father and grandfather, and much further
back still, have been gentlemen commanding their
inferiors, and fulfilling the duties of their station,
should not the traits which mean that show as plainly
as the auctioneer traits show in Fred&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Matilda had no answer ready, she felt resentful; but
words did not come, so Katherine went on:</p>

<p>"You can't jump straight to things; they either have
to come by instinct through a long line of forebears, or
you have to have intelligence enough to make yourself
acquire the outward signs of them, through watching
and learning from those who you can see for yourself
have what you want."</p>

<p>Matilda called for another cup of cocoa&mdash;she disliked
these views of Katherine's.</p>

<p>"You see," that young woman went on, "no one who
is a real thing ever has to tell people so in words. Liv
and Dev don't have to say they are two of the sharpest
business men in London&mdash;anyone can realise it who
knows them. You, and all of us, don't have to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
people we belong to the lower middle class, because it is
plain to be seen, but we would have to tell them we were
ladies and gentlemen, because we are not. Lord Al&mdash;oh!
any lord who comes to our office&mdash;does not have to say
he is an aristocrat; you can see it for yourself in a
minute by his ways. It is the shams that always keep
shouting. Mabel Cawber insists upon it that she is a
tip-top swell; Fred thinks he is deceiving everyone by
telling them what a gentleman he is, and by not speaking
to Ernie Gibbs, who is an awfully good fellow.
Emily says she is a splendid general, and can't even
light a fire, and won't learn how to. George Berker in
our office says he is a first-class clerk, and muddles his
accounts. Everything true speaks for itself. I always
mean to be perfectly true, and win out by learning."</p>

<p>Matilda, though somewhat crushed, was still antagonistic.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I hope you'll succeed then, my dear!" she
snapped.</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall." Katherine fired her bomb. "It may
take me some time, but that does not matter, and the
first step I have already taken is that I am leaving Liv
and Dev's on Friday&mdash;and, I hope, going to be secretary
to Sarah Lady Garribardine, at a hundred and
ten Berkeley Square, and Blissington Court, Blankshire!"</p>

<p>"Well, there! You could have knocked me over with
a feather!" as Matilda told Gladys later in the evening.
"And wasn't it like Katherine never telling us a thing
about it until everything was almost settled!" But at
the moment, she merely breathed a strangled:</p>

<p>"Oh, my!"</p>

<p>"If I get it, I go to my new situation next week. I
had a tremendous piece of luck coming across it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, however did you do it, Kitten?" Matilda demanded.</p>

<p>"I saw an advertisement in the <i>Morning Post</i>&mdash;it
was quite a strange one, and seemed to be advertising for
a kind of <i>Admirable Crichton</i>&mdash;someone who could take
down shorthand at lightning speed, and typewrite and
speak French&mdash;and read aloud, and who had a good
knowledge of English literature, and thoroughly knew
the duties of a secretary."</p>

<p>"Oh! My!" said Matilda again, "but you can't do
half of those things, Kitten&mdash;we none of us know
French, do we!"</p>

<p>Katherine smiled; how little her family understood
her in any way!</p>

<p>"I wrote first and said they seemed to want a great
deal, but as I had been with Livingstone and Devereux
for three years, and accustomed to composing every sort
of letter that a moneylender's business required, I
thought I could soon become proficient in the other
things."</p>

<p>"Well, I never! What cheek!"</p>

<p>"Then I got an answer saying Lady Garribardine
liked my communication, and if I proved satisfactory
in appearance, and had some credentials, she would engage
me immediately, because her secretary, who had
been with her for years, had gone to be married&mdash;the
salary would be ninety pounds a year with a rise, so it's
a slight move up, anyway, as I am to be kept, and live
in the house."</p>

<p>"You are cocksure of getting it, Katherine?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I mean to&mdash;I am going to see her on Saturday."</p>

<p>"And what are your references besides Liv and Dev?
Some folks don't like moneylenders."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wrote and said I had no others&mdash;but they would
testify to my capacity. Liv nearly had a fit when I
gave my notice&mdash;he almost cried to get me to stay on.
I like the old boy&mdash;he is a good sort, and will tell the
truth about me."</p>

<p>"And did they answer?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;just to say I was to come for the interview
on Saturday."</p>

<p>"They want to see you, anyway&mdash;what is the family,
I wonder?"</p>

<p>Here Katherine recited the details from Debrett, in
which volume she was very proficient.</p>

<p>"An old lady, then," Matilda commented, "and with
no children except a married daughter! That will be
easier for you&mdash;but why is she called 'Sarah'? I often
have wondered about that, when I read names in the
<i>Flare</i>. Why 'Sarah Lady Something'&mdash;and not plain
Lady Something?"</p>

<p>"It's when the man in possession is married and you
are not his mother," Katherine told her, "and if you are,
and still have your Christian name tacked on, it is to
make you sound younger. Dev says dowagers are quite
out of fashion. Every widow is 'Sarah' or 'Cordelia'
now in the high society, and when he first went to business,
there were only two or three. Queen Victoria
never stood any nonsense."</p>

<p>Matilda was very interested.</p>

<p>"Whatever will you do about your clothes, Kitten?
You have nothing nobby and smart like Gladys. She
could lend you her purple taffeta if you weren't so tall."</p>

<p>"Oh, I manage all right. I'll have a talk with
Gladys to-night; she sees the right sort of people at
Ermantine's, and can tell me what to get&mdash;and I'll buy
it to-morrow in my lunch hour."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I am just rattled," Matilda admitted. "Then
you'll be leaving home quite, dearie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Tild&mdash;and I shan't be sorry except to be
parted from you&mdash;but I daresay I shall be able to come
and see you now and then."</p>

<p>Matilda looked tearful.</p>

<p>"You never were one of us, Katherine."</p>

<p>"No, I know I never was. I often have wondered
what accident pitchforked me in among you, always the
discordant note and the wet blanket. I hark back to
someone, I suppose&mdash;I've always determined to get out,
when I was ready."</p>

<p>"You never did care for us&mdash;never, Kitten."</p>

<p>Katherine Bush remained quite unmoved.</p>

<p>"No, never for the others&mdash;but always for you, Tild&mdash;and
I'll never forget you, dear. There, don't be a
donkey and cry&mdash;the people at the next table are looking
at you."</p>

<p>This argument she knew would calm her sister&mdash;who
was intensely sensitive to everyone's opinion.</p>

<p>"And supposing they don't take you?" Matilda
suggested, in a still quavering voice, "and you've given
notice to Liv and Dev&mdash;I call it awfully risky."</p>

<p>"Then I will look out for something else&mdash;I am determined
to make a change, and see a new world, whatever
happens."</p>

<p>After supper that evening, Gladys was invited up
to the warmed attic with Matilda, an honour she duly
appreciated. They all stood in irritated awe of Katherine.</p>

<p>"I want to talk about clothes, Glad," she said, when
they neared the tiny fireplace. "I have told Tild I am
going about a new berth on Saturday."</p>

<p>This caused the same astonishment and exclamations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
as Matilda had already indulged in&mdash;and when calm
was restored, Gladys was only too pleased to show her
superior knowledge.</p>

<p>"I don't want to hear about any of those actresses
you dress, or those ladies who look like them, I want
to know what a real, quiet, well-bred countess, say,
would have, Glad."</p>

<p>Miss Gladys Bush smiled contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Oh, a regular frump, you mean&mdash;like the ones we
can't persuade to have tight skirts when they are first
the fashion, or loose ones when it changes&mdash;that is easy
enough&mdash;it is to get 'the look' that is difficult."</p>

<p>"They probably would not engage me if I had 'the
look,'" Katherine remarked cynically.</p>

<p>"You'd better have something like we made for Lady
Beatrice Strobridge last week, then," Gladys suggested.
"One of our hands can copy it at home, but there won't
be time by Saturday. You'd better wear your best
blue serge and get a new hat for the first meeting."</p>

<p>"Lady Beatrice Strobridge must be the Hon. Gerard
Strobridge's wife, my new employer's late husband's
nephew. Strobridge is the Garribardine name." Katherine
had looked up diligently the whole family, and
knew the details of each unit by heart.</p>

<p>"She only got married two years ago," Gladys continued.
"She was Thorvil, before&mdash;Lady Beatrice
Thorvil."</p>

<p>"Wife of the present man's younger brother," quoted
Katherine, remembering Debrett. "He is about thirty-five;
the present man is forty."</p>

<p>"She is a regular dowdy, anyway," Gladys remarked.
"One of those&mdash;we have a bunch of them&mdash;that wants
the things, and yet with their own touch on them, spoiling
the style. They come together generally, and do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
make a lot of fuss over each other&mdash;calling 'darlings'
and 'precious' all the time&mdash;fit to make me and the girls
die laughing with their nonsense."</p>

<p>"What is she like&mdash;good-looking?" Katherine asked.
She only questioned when she wanted specific information,
never idly, and it was as well to know everything
about her possible new employer's family.</p>

<p>"She would not be bad if she did not stoop so. She
hasn't got 'the walk' neither, no more than the 'look';
sometimes she's all right&mdash;at least, the things are all
right when they go home, but she adds bits herself afterwards,
and spoils them."</p>

<p>Here Matilda interrupted.</p>

<p>"Anyway, she is one of the ladies you'll see in your
new place, Kitten. I'd certainly have that same dress,
it will just show them you are as good as they, if you
have an Ermantine model."</p>

<p>But Katherine thought differently. She agreed she
would have something in the same subdued style as
Lady Beatrice would have chosen, but not the actual
copy, and after settling details the other two sisters
left her for bed.</p>

<p>When they had gone, she sat by the fire and looked
deeply into it, while she thought for a few moments.
Then she drew a letter from her blouse and reread it.
It was from Lord Algy. A sweet little love epistle.
Just to tell her he could not possibly wait for the whole
month before seeing her&mdash;and was coming up to town
the following week&mdash;and would not she lunch with him
at the old place&mdash;and perhaps stay with him again at
the Great Terminus? It ended with protestations of
passionate devotion.</p>

<p>No&mdash;never again&mdash;she had tasted of the cup of bliss,
and Fate was asking her to pay no price. She must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
have courage now to renounce all further pleasure.
Once was an experience, twice would be weakness&mdash;which
could grow into a habit&mdash;and thence lead to an
abyss which she shuddered to think of.</p>

<p>Katherine Bush had never read Th&eacute;ophile Gautier's
masterpiece&mdash;but there was something in her character,
as Lord Algy had remarked, which resembled <i>Mademoiselle
de Maupin's</i>.</p>

<p>She went to her little writing-case and got out a
sheet of paper, and then, in her firm round hand which
looked like a man's, she wrote him these few lines:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<i>Dear Algy</i>,
</p>

<p>I want you to forget all about me&mdash;I loved our little trip,
but I am never going on another. I shall have left Liv and
Dev's before you get back, and you won't see me again.
With best love always.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">
K. B.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>She folded it, put it in the envelope&mdash;addressed it
and stamped it&mdash;then she put it ready to post in the
morning.</p>

<p>Her face was white and set. It takes a strong will
to renounce tangible present happiness, however profound
the beliefs in the future may be.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>


<p>Sarah Lady Garribardine said to her nephew,
Gerard Strobridge, who had been lunching with
her on that Saturday:</p>

<p>"You must go now, G. I am expecting a new secretary."</p>

<p>"How will you get on without Miss Arnott, Seraphim?
I thought she was irreplaceable."</p>

<p>"So she is&mdash;I am interviewing quite a new type&mdash;she
has been a moneylender's shorthand typist."</p>

<p>Mr. Strobridge raised his eyebrows&mdash;and smiled his
whimsical smile. His Aunt Sarah always was original.</p>

<p>"Then I'll leave you&mdash;Beatrice has at last made up
her mind not to chuck the Arberrys, so we motor down
at three o'clock."</p>

<p>"Has Beatrice been unusually tiresome?"</p>

<p>"N-no&mdash;she has been writing odes all the morning."</p>

<p>"You ought never to have married, G.&mdash;You would
not have if Alice Southerwood had not become a widow&mdash;a
man can't always face his obvious obligations."</p>

<p>Gerard Strobridge laughed.</p>

<p>"Then I shall kiss your hand and say farewell until
next week&mdash;wisest of aunts!"</p>

<p>He suited the action to the word, and left the room
just as the butler was about to open the door and
announce:</p>

<p>"Miss Bush, Your Ladyship."</p>

<p>He glanced quickly at Katherine&mdash;this was the young
person who would take the estimable Miss Arnott's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
place, he supposed. She was quite ordinary looking.&mdash;He
went on down the stairs.</p>

<p>"Come and sit here in the light, please," Lady
Garribardine said, as Katherine Bush came towards
her.</p>

<p>It was a very well-arranged Katherine, in the best
blue serge&mdash;and a new hat&mdash;not of Gladys' choosing.
The mop of hair was twisted tight without the least
pretension to express "the look,"&mdash;some grey suede
gloves&mdash;bought in Paris by Lord Algy&mdash;were on the
wonderful hands which remained perfectly still in their
owner's lap.</p>

<p>"How old are you?" asked Lady Garribardine by
way of a beginning.</p>

<p>"I was twenty-two last September." There was not
a trace of nervousness in Katherine Bush's deep voice&mdash;indeed
she felt none.</p>

<p>"And what does your family consist of&mdash;what is
your status in life?" Lady Garribardine felt perhaps
she ought to ascertain this before going further.</p>

<p>"We are just middle class. My father was an auctioneer
at Bindon's Green where we live. He and my
mother are both dead. I have a sister who is a saleswoman
at Madame Ermantine's, the others are at home.
My eldest brother has taken father's place, the younger
one is in a bank."</p>

<p>"And how long have you been at this business?"</p>

<p>"Since I was nineteen&mdash;before that I kept the accounts
at a pork butcher's."</p>

<p>"Indeed!&mdash;--And what makes you think you would
be capable of filling my situation?"</p>

<p>"It is not very easy to be a competent moneylender's
secretary and a shorthand writer."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;perhaps not."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Livingston and Mr. Devereux will tell you that
I did not make a failure of it."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>Katherine was silent.</p>

<p>"<i>Really</i>," Lady Garribardine repeated again. "You
mean that you think you can pick up things quickly."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It is certainly an advantage. I hoped to find something
exceptional when I advertised."</p>

<p>"Yes, I noticed that&mdash;and it was because your advertisement
was unusual that I applied for the post."</p>

<p>She rather wondered if she ought to have put in any
"Ladyships"; she remembered Hanson, Lord Algy's
valet, was very prodigal of such marks of respect&mdash;that
is what had deterred her. Liv and Dev often
used them, too&mdash;to new and prosperously connected
clients&mdash;but she did not wish to be subservient more
than was necessary. She would watch and listen&mdash;as
she had watched about the oysters.</p>

<p>"Can you read aloud?"</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine was fixing her with her flashing
brown eyes, which contrasted so unfavourably with the
bronze-gold wig she wore so bravely.</p>

<p>"I have never tried. If I did it wrong the first time
and you corrected me, I expect I wouldn't do it twice."</p>

<p>"That is something&mdash;and your voice is refined&mdash;you
did not acquire that at the&mdash;er&mdash;pork butcher's?"</p>

<p>"No, I acquired it by listening to members of the
upper classes who came to borrow money&mdash;I had a
cockney twang like my sisters, I daresay, in the beginning."</p>

<p>"That shows you can learn things."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is only stupid people who can't."</p>

<p>"You are not stupid, then?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, but Mr. Livingston or Mr. Devereux can tell
you; either will speak for me."</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine was amused; she digressed a little
from her cross-examination.</p>

<p>"You found Jews agreeable to work with?"</p>

<p>"Very. You know where you are with them. They
do not pretend, and they are very generous."</p>

<p>"In-deed!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;people have a preconceived notion of Jews, I
find&mdash;quite faulty as a rule&mdash;they know what to pay
for&mdash;they are far less fools than other races. I respect
them."</p>

<p>"That is most interesting."</p>

<p>Katherine was silent again.</p>

<p>"Why did you leave them?"&mdash;after a pause in which
Lady Garribardine was pitilessly scrutinising her possible
secretary.</p>

<p>"Because I had learned all that I could there, and I
wanted a new vista&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you think you would find it with me?"</p>

<p>"With any lady in your world&mdash;you can learn things
wherever you go, if you wish to."</p>

<p>"Very true. And how about French&mdash;you speak
that?"</p>

<p>Katherine Bush reddened a little. A memory came
to her of the profound shock that the French of Paris
had been to her ear.</p>

<p>"I can write it quite correctly&mdash;but I have discovered
that my pronunciation is ridiculous." She confessed
it quite frankly.</p>

<p>"How did that happen?"</p>

<p>"I taught it to myself&mdash;mostly&mdash;and then I heard it
spoken&mdash;and I knew mine would sound wrong."</p>

<p>"Do you think you could overcome that?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, if I were in France long enough."</p>

<p>"Have you travelled?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not really. I have been to Paris for a holiday
once&mdash;I have only learnt about places."</p>

<p>"And English literature?"</p>

<p>"It is the thing I care most for&mdash;I have read a great
many books. I read usually until about one in the
morning."</p>

<p>"Have you a good temper? You are not uppish,
eh?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it depends&mdash;I know that when you take
money to do a thing you have got to do it, and put
up with orders and manners that you would not stand
for one second if you were the person paying."</p>

<p>"That is quite a good definition of respectful service."</p>

<p>"It is common sense."</p>

<p>"You appear to have some of that."</p>

<p>Again silence.</p>

<p>"I have not a good temper!" Lady Garribardine
laughed&mdash;she was greatly diverted.</p>

<p>"I guessed not."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I had to read characters quickly at Livingston and
Devereux's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are observant?"</p>

<p>"I think so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can you play the piano?"</p>

<p>"I could once, and I had a queer gift for reading
the notes&mdash;but I have never practised since we had a
gramophone&mdash;I grew to loathe music."</p>

<p>"That is hopeful&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then Her Ladyship got up and went to her writing-table,
terribly littered with all sorts of papers. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
dived among a conglomerate mass&mdash;and picked up two
letters.</p>

<p>"Would you oblige me by answering these, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Bush?
I could then better judge of your capabilities."</p>

<p>Katherine took them; on one envelope was written in
a spidery hand in pencil, "Refuse gracefully;" upon
the other, "Get out as best can."</p>

<p>She looked for a portion of the blotting pad which
was clear enough to use, then she sat down and selected
a pen, while she glanced up with her steady wise eyes.</p>

<p>"Has Your Ladyship any particular paper for this
sort of thing?" Here was a suitable moment for the
use of the honorific she felt.</p>

<p>"Yes, that white paper with the coronet in plain
black and the address."</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine sat down by the fire and stared
into it. She had not been so interested in a specimen
of humanity for years.</p>

<p>Katherine Bush read the letters through carefully
and the first one a second time, then she began to write:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To the Secretary of the League for Discouraging Polygamy
among the Mohammedans of India:</p>

<p>
<i>Dear Sir</i>,<br />
</p>

<p>I am asked by Sarah Lady Garribardine, to tell you that
while sympathising deeply with the admirable object of
your League, she thinks the field over which it must obviously
be spread is too vast for a small contribution to be
of much avail, and therefore, while thanking you for your
interesting papers upon the subject, she is sorry that she is
unable to forward you any more substantial help.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">
I am, dear sir,<br />
Yours faithfully,<br />
<span class="smcap">Katherine Bush</span> (Secretary).<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>The other letter ran:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To the Matron of the Nonconformist Detention and Penitential
Hostel for Lost Women:</p>

<p>
<i>Madam</i>,<br />
</p>

<p>I beg to inform you that Sarah Lady Garribardine is
leaving town shortly and therefore cannot avail herself of
the pleasure and honour of visiting your useful institution.
She desires me to express to you her thanks for your invitation.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">
I remain, madame,<br />
Yours faithfully,<br />
<span class="smcap">K. Bush</span> (Sec.).<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>She looked carefully to see what style of address was
necessary and wrote out the envelope&mdash;and when all
was ready she rose and took them to the young-old lady
by the fire.</p>

<p>She stood quite still while they were perused, and then
smiled inwardly when Lady Garribardine gave a cynical
chuckle.</p>

<p>"I think you will do very well, Miss Bush! Please
find some stamps, and put them in that basket to be
posted&mdash;and&mdash;er&mdash;you can ring the bell&mdash;I shall expect
you&mdash;bag and baggage&mdash;on Wednesday next."</p>

<p>This was abrupt, but Katherine Bush felt it was
what it should be.</p>

<p>"You do not require the testimony of Mr. Livingston
or Mr. Devereux?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I can judge for myself&mdash;er&mdash;Good morning."</p>

<p>The bell had been answered almost instantly and so,
bowing, Katherine Bush followed the servant down the
stairs, and soon found herself in the street, a strange
sense of content in her heart.</p>

<p>She knew the West End very well&mdash;and walked
briskly along Hill Street and so on past Dorchester<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
House&mdash;into the Park. All the leaves were off the
trees. The November day was beautifully fine and
bright and movement was a pleasure.</p>

<p>So the first part of her new game was won at
all events.</p>

<p>She reviewed the whole set of impressions she had
taken. Firstly, that the house was a fine one&mdash;it had
"the look," if houses could be said to show this quality.
That is, it was beautifully kept and filled with what she
guessed from study at the Wallace Collection must be
rare and costly furniture. There were some things she
thought ugly&mdash;but "the look" was often ugly, she knew
by experience&mdash;from Gladys' verbose descriptions to
Ethel and Matilda.</p>

<p>Apart from "the look" it had an air of distinction.
It was the abode of denizens of Lord Algy's world&mdash;that
was evident. The man she had met on the threshold
of the morning room door was certainly of his
class&mdash;and rather nice-looking.</p>

<p>As for her future employer, she was a new specimen
to her. Katherine meant what the French call a <i>type</i>,
but she did not know this expression.</p>

<p>"She is certainly over sixty," she said to herself.
"She is a dark woman naturally, and her hair ought to
be grey. The whole thing is spoilt by that silly golden
wig&mdash;curled tight like Royalty's. She would have quite
a nice figure for her age if she were not all pushed up
by those old-fashioned corsets. Why had she such big
ears and such red hands for so great a lady? Her
rings were buried in fat. The circulation was evidently
wrong somewhere. As for her voice&mdash;it was one of <i>the</i>
voices! The female counterpart of the echoes from
over the glass screen&mdash;and the manner was quite as
casual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just as insolent as I shall be when I hold the same
sort of place. She was born to it&mdash;I shall have acquired
it&mdash;we both when we are dead will be said to
have well filled our situations."</p>

<p>Thus mused Katherine Bush on a November day in
Hyde Park&mdash;and turning out of Albert Gate suddenly
she almost walked into the arms of Lord Algy.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>


<p>"Darling pet! What a delightful surprise!"</p>

<p>"Algy! Where did you spring from?"</p>

<p>Then they both drew quick breaths.</p>

<p>"Come back towards the Serpentine, I must talk to
you. Your horrid little note made me feel quite
wretched, and I have been to Liv and Dev's to-day, and
they refused to give me your address&mdash;why were you
such a little cat, darling?"</p>

<p>"I was not a cat, Algy."</p>

<p>They had turned and were walking towards the Row.</p>

<p>"I meant what I wrote&mdash;I want you to forget all
about me. Joys can't go on&mdash;I have other things to
do, dear."</p>

<p>"But it is perfectly brutal of you, Katherine, when
I love you so&mdash;and you love me&mdash;at least you told me
that you did!"</p>

<p>Katherine Bush's heart was beating very fast&mdash;would
she have courage to keep to her determination now that
she saw him face to face?</p>

<p>He looked so extremely delectable, here in the lowering
sunshine. He was everything that a woman could
desire in the way of a lover.</p>

<p>"I am in the hell of a mess, too," he sighed. "My
father has cut up awfully rough about my transactions
with Liv and Dev&mdash;and I had a bad week at Doncaster.
I am in for a regular facer and am obliged to agree to
be transferred to the Egyptian army for three years.
Everything, even you, are against me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I am not, Algy." There was quick sympathy
and distress in her deep voice. "I hate to think that
you are unhappy, and you know that I would help you
in any way I could."</p>

<p>"Then be kind to me, darling&mdash;and don't say you
never want to see me again."</p>

<p>Katherine Bush felt this was a supreme occasion&mdash;and
that she must not waver. She so longed to comfort
him, to let him kiss her and forget all his cares.
The cynical side of her character, even at this moving
moment, whispered that it was fortunate that they were
out of doors!</p>

<p>"When do you start for Egypt?"</p>

<p>"As soon as I can get ready&mdash;my mother and sisters
are going to winter out there, but probably I shall be
sent to the Soudan!"</p>

<p>Katherine had heard that they killed lions or something
in that part of the world, she knew that sport
meant a great deal in Lord Algy's life.</p>

<p>"You will get some kind of shooting, won't you?" she
suggested by way of consolation.</p>

<p>But Lord Algy looked full of misery. They had
walked on, taking a side path and were now in sight of
two chairs.</p>

<p>"Let us go and sit down," he pleaded. "I want to
look at you. I can't, I won't believe, that you don't
mean ever to be my own girl any more."</p>

<p>"Algy, I do mean it&mdash;just as much for you as for
myself."</p>

<p>They had reached the chairs and sat down, Lord
Algy pushed his hat to the back of his head; his immaculately
brushed hair glistened bronze in the setting
sun, and his forehead was puckered with distress. His
attractive eyes sought hers with a fond persistence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Katherine Bush was obliged to clench her hands tight
in the pockets of her coat.</p>

<p>"Why, what in Heaven's name for? Why must we
part?" he demanded fiercely. "Katherine, I have missed
you awfully&mdash;I have not known what to do with myself&mdash;and
before this bother fell upon me, I had determined
to come up to ask you to marry me&mdash;we'd be
awfully happy married, darling&mdash;like we were in Paris.
I have never loved anything half so much as our time
together."</p>

<p>"It is dear of you to say that, but I would not marry
you for anything in the world, it would spoil everything,
destroy a memory that has not got any flaw in
it.&mdash;Listen to me, Algy&mdash;I went with you because I
wanted to&mdash;I wanted to understand life, and find out
what is worth while, and what men are like. I am only
at the beginning of existence and I intend to learn most
of its meaning before I die. I thought that whatever
cold, tiresome path I might have to follow afterwards,
to carry out my scheme of things, I would at least have
some good hours to remember with you, so I went deliberately&mdash;but
I never meant to do it again. Let's
both be grateful for what we have had and part
friends."</p>

<p>"I simply can't," protested Lord Algy, growing more
and more full of emotion, as he felt the attainment of
his desires receding from him. "I call it awfully cold-blooded
of you, Katherine, and I can't and won't consent
to it. I want you&mdash;I want you now&mdash;to-night,"
and he stretched out his arms. "I am sick with longing
for you&mdash;I mean it, darling. I have been away with
other girls often before, Jack Kilcourcy and I stayed
down the river with Laure de Laine and Mary Green
this June. Laure was my friend, and she simply wasn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
a patch on you, pet, in any way, and I didn't care a
straw when it was over, although they are such celebrities,
and it did make Berty Aberhams so mad, and was
such a score off the bounder. I have never felt anything
like I feel for you, darling&mdash;I want you to be
my wife."</p>

<p>As he spoke, something withered a little in Katherine
Bush; his unconscious placing of the affair galled her,
although she knew that it was perfectly just; she had
gone with him under no other pretence than had gone
those ladies of the Frivolity Theatre. She analysed his
simple directness, and appreciated the triumph conveyed
to her in the final expression of his feelings, but
it made her task rather easier. She saw so plainly what
a renewal of their relations would mean. She looked
and looked at him, seated dejectedly there beside her,
and then she spoke, and her voice was full of quiet
determination and very deep.</p>

<p>"You must be a man, Algy, dear, and go on and
make something of your life, as I mean to do. You must
be a great soldier. You come of such a grand old family,
you ought to remember what all your ancestors
have done, and try to be as fine as they were&mdash;It's so
paltry to drift&mdash;You can remember me if you want to&mdash;as
someone who wasn't weak, even though I am only
a common girl, and much beneath you in class. If I
was of your class I should now be tempted to marry
you, and then I expect with my sort of nature I'd just
shove you on into doing something great. But I couldn't
as it is, all my time would be taken up with trying to
educate myself to keep my own head above water, and
trying to suppress my humiliation at the contempt of
your friends. You are only a younger son, and they
would never forgive you, and we would just lead a hole
and corner sort of existence in wretched poverty, and
grow to have quarrels and not love at all."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>He was going to interrupt her but she put her grey
gloved hand across his lips. "No, dear, don't say anything&mdash;I
want to go away from you with the memory
that you have asked me to be your wife&mdash;I cannot be
that for both our sakes, and it would cut me to the
heart to hear you say words, now that you know this,
which would mean that you want me, failing that, to go
on with the other relation."&mdash;She paused, for a second,
and leaning forward, looked straight into his face&mdash;"Algy,
I want to remember you as a really perfect gentleman."</p>

<p>She had gained her point with this last appeal. She
saw that in an instant; he straightened himself and
raised his handsome head, while the pride of race looked
forth from his eyes for a moment, and then was
quenched by the mist of tears.</p>

<p>"You are a splendid girl, Katherine," he said in a
choking voice, "a far greater lady than the rotters I
have to dance with at balls and see as my sisters'
friends. You&mdash;by Jove! you have taught me to respect
women. I should be honoured if you would marry me,
and my family ought to be jolly glad to get such a
good sort among them!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Algy!" her voice now trembled, too.
"Then you understand, dear, and I want you to do just
as well as you can in Egypt&mdash;and, and&mdash;Algy, do try
not to spend so much money, and when they have paid
up for you, don't go and get back into any moneylender's
hands. They are not all so honest as Liv and Dev.
And now I want to say good-bye! I don't want to be
silly and&mdash;cry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! it's too cruel!" he exclaimed, clasping his hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
"Katherine, you are like&mdash;only I think you mean to be
kinder than she was&mdash;<i>Mademoiselle de Maupin</i>!"</p>

<p>She stiffened, and her eyes, which were growing very
misty, became hard and bright. She thought he was referring
to another lady of the half-world&mdash;of Paris,
perhaps, this time. He saw that she had misunderstood
him, and he added quickly:</p>

<p>"Darling, she is in a book&mdash;by a fellow called Th&eacute;ophile
Gautier&mdash;she was a wonder and so are you&mdash;I've
always thought you were like her, but&mdash;Oh! why do we
talk such bosh about books in our few moments, I want
to tell you that I love you. Oh! Katherine, if you knew
how much!"</p>

<p>The hardness all melted from the young woman's
grey-green eyes and was replaced by a divine sweetness.</p>

<p>"Algy," she whispered, "it is good to hear that, and
you know that I love you, too, and now good-bye, my
dear&mdash;I can't bear any more."</p>

<p>She rose quickly and drew her hand away. She passionately
longed for him to take her in his arms.</p>

<p>He got up also, he was extremely pale, and more than
a suspicion of mist hung upon his eyelashes. As a
young, splendid lover, he could not have looked more
desirable, but Katherine Bush never lost her head.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Algy, and God bless you, dear."</p>

<p>Two people were approaching or he certainly would
have kissed her&mdash;as it was they only wrung each other's
hands and Katherine Bush turned and walked into the
gathering twilight.</p>

<p>He watched her until she had disappeared and then
sat down again. He felt quite wretched. She seemed
to him to be a wonderful character.</p>

<p>"What an impotent wretch I am beside her," he said
to himself. "But I should never be able to make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
family see it. My mother would rather I married
Elaine Percival with her five thousand a year&mdash;" then
he laughed contemptuously&mdash;"Elaine Percival!"</p>

<p>For the first time in his life he began to reason about
things. Katherine Bush was of course perfectly right.
Marriage would have been madness, as he had always
known before he became too much in love to think;
and he knew he had been lately only entirely influenced
by selfish desire, and had never so much as faced what
the consequences would be either to himself or to her.
He had been quite ready to make a hash of both their
lives just because he wanted her so badly for the moment.
What an incredible fool&mdash;and she, this fine girl,
had pulled them both on to firm land. He was not of
the type who could contemplate asking a woman to wait
for him while he worked to obtain a home for her; such
an idea, of course, never entered his head. He had no
romantic illusions of this sort, and once having realised
the hopelessness of the case he had stoicism enough to
accept it. But the things she had said affected him
deeply. He would try not to drift.&mdash;He would pull
himself together and do his best to become a fine soldier.
They should not say he had grumbled over going
to Egypt. Oh! if there could only be a war, that he
might go out and fight! But wars would never happen
again at this time of the world's day!</p>

<p>The present pleasant, easy stage of his life had come
to an end, and unpleasant realities must be dealt with,
but he would keep ever the memory of this splendid girl
in his heart, the memory that she had not been weak or
permitted him to make a fool of himself or of her.</p>

<p>And as he walked on out of the Park he felt a new
self-reliance and determination.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Katherine Bush had got into an omni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>bus
and was on the way to Victoria, and once arrived at
Laburnum Villa and her attic, she carefully wrote down
on the little book which she kept for jottings, "<i>Mademoiselle
de Maupin</i>, in a book by Th&eacute;ophile Gautier,"
while her thoughts ran:</p>

<p>"He did not say what was the name of the story, but
I can read the whole lot this man wrote. I'll go to a
French library on Monday."</p>

<p>Then she sat down in her armchair by the fire and
reviewed the entire chain of events.</p>

<p>She was embarked upon a new current which would
help to carry her to some definite goal&mdash;she was out of
the backwater. It was not a voyage to Cythera, but
youth was at the prow, and ambition, not pleasure, at
the helm; and there live philosophers who say these two
things bring more lasting good than all the bliss that is
to be snatched from the other combination.&mdash;Who
knows!&mdash;They may be right!</p>

<p>Matilda was nervous with excitement when after supper
she was told of the definite settlement of her sister's
affairs.</p>

<p>"So you are really engaged, Kitten!" she exclaimed.
"Now, do tell me all about it. There's a dear&mdash;and
what was she like, and is it a grand house and are you
going to be properly treated as a real lady?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am engaged. I am to go in on Wednesday,
'bag and baggage,' as Lady Garribardine said."</p>

<p>"My! what a vulgar expression for a lady to use, Kitten&mdash;are
you sure she's all right?"</p>

<p>Matilda hated what was not genteel.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, Tild&mdash;she's all right&mdash;and the house is
beautiful&mdash;and, yes, what you'd call grand&mdash;and you
may be sure they will treat me exactly in the way I
deserve to be treated. If you aren't respected it's your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
own fault&mdash;people don't make a mistake as to whom
they are with a second time, even if they do the first.
If anyone gets put upon continually, or gets snubbed,
it's her own fault."</p>

<p>Matilda totally disagreed.</p>

<p>"There you are quite wrong. Why, look at Gladys!
Bob treats her anyhow sometimes of a Sunday, and her
as good as gold."</p>

<p>"Well, she has made him think that he can by not
stopping it in the beginning. It is never a question of
goodness as I often tell you about things, it is a question
of force. Goodness does not count unless it is so
perfect that it is a force, too&mdash;like Christ's."</p>

<p>"Oh, my! What awful things you do say, Katherine!"</p>

<p>Matilda felt so uncomfortable when her sister spoke
of what she thought ought only to be mentioned in
church!</p>

<p>"No, I merely tell the truth, it is the weaklings who
do all the harm in the world, never the bad or good."</p>

<p>"Well, what was Lady Garribardine like?" Matilda
was tired of abstract speculations.</p>

<p>"She was tall and rather stout, and had a golden wig&mdash;and
black eyes&mdash;and she understood things. She
knows how to order her house, because the servants had
the same awe for her as the office-boy has for Liv. Her
writing-table was awfully untidy, though. I expect she
has not much method, and it is just personality and
temper which causes her to be obeyed."</p>

<p>"You won't stand being ordered about ever, Kitten?"</p>

<p>"It will depend on how much good I feel I am getting
out of it. If the place and people in it are being lessons
for me, I shan't mind what she says&mdash;I shall stick
it out and try never really to deserve a scolding."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Was there anyone else there?" Matilda was still
curious.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a man left when I was going in. He had a
clever face. I shall like him, I believe, if he comes there
often."</p>

<p>"You won't go falling in love with any of them gentlemen,
Kitten," Matilda pleaded affectionately.</p>

<p>She felt that things might develop as they did in the
cases of the innocent actresses and governesses and the
villains in her serials.</p>

<p>"Have I ever been given to falling in love?" Katherine
asked with a humorous flash in her eyes.&mdash;"You
have not seen me tumble into the arms of Charlie Prodgers
or Percy Watson&mdash;have you?"</p>

<p>"No, dearie, but these gentlemen in your new biz
might be different and might not mean so honest by
you. I do wish I could hope to see you settled with
Charlie some day. He is such a dear fellow, and very
rising. He'll be head clerk at the estate agent's he is
in very soon, and could give you a comfortable home like
this is for your own; and no need to be hanging on for
years like Glad and Bob."</p>

<p>"Can you picture me settled in a comfortable home
with Charlie Prodgers, Tild!" Katherine laughed out
at the idea, it seemed so comic to her. "He is as great
a snob as Fred, and even more ignorant. I would not
let him button my boots, much less call himself my husband!
I'd as soon be dead as tied to that! At Brixton,
too! With the prospect of being the mother of
numbers of sandy-haired little Prodgers. What an outlook!"</p>

<p>Matilda was hurt. They had never spoken in words
upon this secret hope of hers, but she had often hinted
at it, and Katherine had been silent and seemingly pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>occupied,
but not actually scornful, and to have the
scheme denounced with derision and the happy picture
scoffed at was a blow to her which she could not bear
in silence. She felt indignant.</p>

<p>"Charlie Prodgers is good enough for any young
lady. Mabel herself thinks highly of him. He is one
of the few of Fred's gentlemen friends that she thinks
worthy to be asked into her mother's house&mdash;and I
would have liked to have seen you married into her set
safely before she becomes our sister-in-law, and can
patronise you."</p>

<p>"Then I am afraid I must disappoint you, dear,"
Katherine now tried to hide her smile. "I have quite
another game to play in life. But why don't you keep
him for Ethel&mdash;she is nearly sixteen and will soon be
looking out for a young man&mdash;or take him yourself?"</p>

<p>This was a new idea for Matilda. She had always
been too loyal to dream of turning her eye in the direction
of one whom she regarded as exclusively her sister's
property.</p>

<p>She bridled a little&mdash;the picture was so glorious&mdash;if
it only could be hers! Charlie Prodgers who scorned
to be seen in anything but a frock coat, unless, of
course, he went golfing&mdash;Charlie Prodgers who each
Sunday attended the church parade in Hyde Park as
a matter of course! But would he ever look at her?
Proud, haughty fellow! and she not so pretty as Katherine&mdash;and
not half so nobby as Gladys. But stranger
things than that happened in her serials, and she need
not feel that it was quite hopeless. But how could
Kitten willingly relinquish such triumph? There must
be something of a suffragette in her after all, since no
girl in her senses could ask more of fortune!</p>

<p>The Sunday was spent by Katherine in packing up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
all her belongings and in selecting the books she meant
to take with her, a volume or two of Voltaire, Bacon's
Essays, Kant and Bergson, and a new acquisition,
Otto Weininger's "Sex and Character." This latter
had interested her deeply. There was a great deal of
biting truth in his analysis of women, and it was probably
also true that they did not possess souls; but she
totally disagreed with his ending of the matter that the
solution of the problem lay in a voluntary annihilation
of the human species through abstinence from procreation.
She, for her part, thought that it was taking
things out of the Hand of God, or the Divine Essence,
or whatever the great Principle should be called&mdash;and
her eminently practical mind failed to see the use of
such far-reaching speculations. "The poor man was
mad, of course," she said, as she closed the book again
before packing it. "But I will try to watch the feminine
traits in myself and crush them. He has taught
me that amount, in any case. And if I have no soul, I
have a brain and a will, and so I am going to obtain
as much as a woman can get with those two things. As
for the infinite, men are welcome to that, as far as I
am concerned!"</p>

<p>She looked forward with deep interest to perusing
the story with <i>Mademoiselle de Maupin</i> in it. What
could it be about? She had hardly thought that Lord
Algy had read at all, he never spoke of books&mdash;but it
was perhaps not surprising; they had been always too
occupied in more agreeable converse. How good it was
to remember all that, even though never in her life she
should have such foolish sweetness again!</p>

<p>She had not the slightest sentiment about "leaving
home"; she would have found such a thing quite ridiculous.
On the contrary, a sense of exaltation filled her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
She was going forever from this cramped, small attic
and the uncongenial environment of the house. And she
must hold herself in stern command and never waste an
opportunity to improve herself in manner and mind.
Of course, she might be liable to make a few mistakes
at first, and the work might be hard, but if will was
strong and emotions were checked, the road to success
and development of her personality could not be a long
one. And when she had gained freedom&mdash;how splendidly
would she use it! There should be no false values
for her!</p>

<p>Her new dress, the one in the style of Lady Beatrice
Strobridge, would be home by the Tuesday night, and
she had got a "dressy" blouse from Oxford Street, in
case she should ever have to appear in the evenings.
She would do very well, she felt.</p>

<p>The family, with the exception of Matilda, were not
sorry that she was departing. The father had left Laburnum
Villa and a certain sum to keep it up for the
benefit of the whole bunch of them; and when Mr. Frederick
Bush would move into a house of his own with
the refined Mabel Cawber, Gladys and Bert and Ethel
looked forward to an uninterrupted time of jollity, unclouded
by Katherine's aloofness and contempt.</p>

<p>Matilda alone grieved in secret. She thought Katherine
was superior to them all in spite of her reserve,
and the last evening, while she sat with her by the attic
fire, she told her so.</p>

<p>"No, I am not, Tild&mdash;I am not superior. I am just
different&mdash;all our aims are as wide apart as the poles.
Glad and Ethel and the boys never want to learn anything&mdash;they
resent the thought that there could be
anything that they do not know. Their whole attitude
is resentful towards any knowledge. They like to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
browse on deceiving themselves over every question and
aspect of life. So they will all just stay where they are.
Fred, an auctioneer, henpecked by Mabel; Bert, a clerk.
Poor Glad, the downtrodden drudge of Bob Hartley,
and Ethel probably something of the same. You, dear
old Tild, will be a sentimental old maid looking after the
others' children&mdash;because you are entirely a 'mother
woman'&mdash;unless you take Charlie Prodgers, as I said
the other day, and have heaps of little Prodgers! Oh!
it is all just respectable, comfortable squalor&mdash;and
words won't express how glad I am to get out of it!"</p>

<p>Matilda was quite incensed.</p>

<p>"I'd rather be a lady, however poor, in my own circle,
and treated as such there, than a servant in a grand
house as you're going to be, Kitten. I'd let them see
I'd be above taking their orders!"</p>

<p>She hoped this taunt would tell, but Katherine only
smiled.</p>

<p>"Poor, dear old Tild," she said. "You do not know,
perhaps, that it is a wise man who understands how to
obey those placed over him, and to exact the same obedience
from those beneath. When I have learned my
lessons and have obtained a place of command, then I
shall not only enforce obedience, but I shall remove
from my path anyone who crosses my will."</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" gasped Matilda.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I argued with Liv and Dev and
showed them that I would not take their orders? No,
of course not; they valued me and raised my salary because
I did what I was told to do. They were paying
me money and were in a position to command. No one
forced me to take their money; I went there of my own
free will, and was to do specified things for a specified
remuneration. I did them to the best of my ability, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
so I am going on to something better. Lady Garribardine
is paying me ninety pounds a year with a rise; and
I am to be hers to command for certain things. When
I have learned all that that situation can teach me, I
shall get a larger and higher position, and so on
until I reach my goal, when I shall rule&mdash;do not fear,
Tild. <i>I shall rule.</i>"</p>

<p>"I daresay you will," Matilda admitted, awed.</p>

<p>Katherine's face had a strange, compelling force
when she spoke thus.</p>

<p>"But we aren't all the same, Kitten. Glad, for instance,
has more pride; look how she left Brown and
Melbury's, where she was getting more than at Ermantine's,
because she would not take orders from the new
manager they put over her department."</p>

<p>"That sort of pride was entirely worthy of Gladys'
intelligence, and it had landed her with a less salary, no
one's added respect, and not much to look forward to in
the future." And then, with a burst of feeling, "Oh!
Tild, if I only could make laws, I would enforce education
to such an extent that there could not be left any
fools like Gladys!"</p>

<p>Then she said good-night to Matilda and gently
pushed her from the room, where she looked as though
she meant to stay for another half-hour, and returning
to her armchair, she began to read that book of Th&eacute;ophile
Gautier's which she had bought on the Monday
morning, and discovered that its title was simply "Mademoiselle
de Maupin."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>


<p>Lady Garribardine was having a tea-party
with some good music, when Katherine Bush arrived.
She realised immediately that it was
stupid of her to have chosen the afternoon for her entrance
into her new post, and Bronson, the dignified
butler, left her in no doubt as to his view of the matter,
as he directed the hurried transport of her luggage
through the hall.</p>

<p>"Her Ladyship expected you this morning, miss,"
he said, severely.</p>

<p>"Then she should have told me at what hour I was
to come," Katherine answered, quietly; "she mentioned
none."</p>

<p>Bronson stared. Miss Arnott, clergyman's daughter
though she was, would never have said a thing like that;
she would have been nervous and apologetic in a minute,
poor thing! But this young woman, whom Bronson
had very good reason to believe, from what he had
been able to gather, belonged merely to the lower middle
class, had yet the audacity to give herself all the
airs and calm assurance appertaining to a lady of the
world!</p>

<p>Here the entrance of two guests took up his attention,
a man and a woman.</p>

<p>Katherine stood back and waited for directions, while
she watched closely. The man was the same that she
had seen on the former occasion. The woman interested
her; she was tall and droopy, with wide vague<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
eyes, and a wisp of buffish chiffon about her neck inside
her furs, which Bronson assisted her to remove. Then
Katherine saw that she wore the dress which Gladys
had described, and which in its general features had
been taken more or less as the model for her own.</p>

<p>This must be Lady Beatrice Strobridge.</p>

<p>"Gerard," the lady said, rather querulously, "I don't
mean to stay for more than ten minutes&mdash;so don't get
away into some difficult corner with L&auml;o, if you mean
to leave with me."</p>

<p>The man answered with polite indifference.</p>

<p>"Bronson will see you safely to the motor; I promised
my aunt to stay to hear Venzoni; he is sure to be
late."</p>

<p>Then they went on up the marble stairs and a young
footman was sent with Katherine Bush in the lift at the
back of the hall.</p>

<p>"'Gerard'&mdash;it is a nice name&mdash;and he looks a nice
man," she mused, while they were carried aloft, "and
he is bored with his wife. Gladys was quite right; why
did she have that rag of chiffon? It spoilt the whole
dress."</p>

<p>The housekeeper met her when they arrived in the
top passage, and took her under her wing.</p>

<p>"Some tea will be sent to your room, miss," she informed
her, "and Her Ladyship said she would not have
time to see you this evening, but you would doubtless
have things to unpack and arrangements to make for
yourself. Your trunks will be up in a minute."</p>

<p>And then she opened the door into a back room which
faced west, so the afterglow of the setting sun made
it not quite dark. There was a fire burning, and it all
appeared gay when the housekeeper turned on the
lights, with its old-fashioned rose-flowered chintz on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
bright parrot-green ground. There was a scent of
lavender, too, and Katherine Bush was pleasantly impressed;
nothing looked cheap and gimcrack like the
bedrooms in Laburnum Villa, she thought, or still more
those at the house of Mabel Cawber, which were the
envy of Matilda's soul. The furniture here was solid
mahogany of early Victorian make, and the armchair
gave the impression that it would be a pleasant place
to rest in.</p>

<p>When she was alone, Katherine Bush made herself
take in every detail. Lady Garribardine had suggested
that she was observant; she must remember that and always
cultivate this faculty, for she realised that every
trifling thing would be different from anything she had
ever known.</p>

<p>She liked the space of the place, she would not feel
that she was tumbling over things. There was an
empty bookcase awaiting her books, no doubt, and a
big sensible writing-table there in the window where
there would be plenty of light. The wardrobe was a
monster, ample room in it for any amount of clothes!
How pleasant not to have to put most things away in
cardboard boxes under one's bed&mdash;often to find them
discoloured by dust when taking them out again! And
how pretty and quaint was the china on the washstand,
matching the chintz. And the towels! Of finer quality&mdash;and
nearly as many as there had been at the Palatial
in Paris, which she had supposed was a case of French
hotel extravagance and not what would be the custom
in private life.</p>

<p>She fingered them softly. They were arranged peculiarly,
too, with the top fold turned back so that one
could pick them up in a second. Katherine Bush
smiled cynically when she remembered her two coarse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
huckabacks, changed only every Saturday at Laburnum
Villa!</p>

<p>Everything gave the impression of spotless cleanliness
and order. The brass hot-water can and the fender
and the fire-irons all shone with superlative polishing.</p>

<p>Presently her tea was brought up by a housemaid in
neatest black, with a cap and apron which would have
made Em'ly snort with indignation had she been asked
to wear them, so unmodish was their style! It was a
joy to have a perfectly arranged tea-tray with shining
silver and pretty porcelain, a tray all to herself, too,
instead of a breakfast cup already poured out and
mixed with milk and sugar, and probably a little of the
contents upset into the saucer, which also contained a
thick slice of bread and butter and a piece of cake! This
is what she had always been accustomed to at the office,
or on Saturday afternoons at home, while she read her
books and a sister brought her tea up to her attic. And
with the exceptions of a Lyons or an A. B. C. restaurant,
and the brief time of glory in Paris, when chocolate
was the order of the day, this one unappetizing cup
had represented to her what many women look forward
to as the most delightful meal of all.</p>

<p>The housemaid's manner had been quiet and respectful,
as she drew the curtains and shut out the dying
light, the muffin was done to a turn, and, above all, the
tea tasted as tea had never tasted before. She was too
ignorant as yet to know that it was China, not the rankest
Ceylon which she was accustomed to, but she found
it particularly nice, though rather weak. The whole
room and the service and the atmosphere spoke of inhabitants
who, somehow she knew, belonged to the same
class as those whose voices she had always admired
from beyond the half-high glass screen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>She sat and dreamed for a while before beginning her
unpacking. Her heart ached underneath for Lord
Algy&mdash;but aches are possible to bear when there is an
element of triumph and self-glorification about them.
She was quite aware that she had behaved remarkably
well, and in a manner which Lord Algy could never look
back upon but with respect. And to renounce happiness
and union when the other person is clamouring for
a continuance of relations, brings a great measure of
consolation, because there is no wound to the self-love,
no disastrous feeling that but for personal stupidity
the ache need not be. There is even a melancholy pleasure
in it, giving a pensive sadness not all pain.</p>

<p>After a while, she began to arrange her clothes and
books, and it had struck seven o'clock before all was
complete and she had sat down again to finish "Mademoiselle
de Maupin," which had so thrilled her far into
the night.</p>

<p>She read French quite easily, but she was not accustomed
to judge of its style, and as yet hardly appreciated
<i>nuances</i>, but the story, the cynical, enchanting,
wonderful story, seized hold of her imagination. As she
read the last words, the book dropped into her lap and
she stared in front of her. She saw what Lord Algy
had meant&mdash;and it flattered her greatly. She understood
entirely <i>Th&eacute;dore's</i> feelings. How wise she had
been to go! How she had grasped the salient points
of life! And she, Katherine Bush, no great lady, but a
daughter of the lower middle class, had evolved some
such instincts herself&mdash;had played her game with equal
coolness, and had lived through some such joys.</p>

<p>She thrilled and thrilled. The subtle, whimsical, polished
wit of the book seemed to open some new vista of
comprehension to her. She did not perceive its im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>morality.
She would read it over again and again&mdash;and
everything else this man had written. It seemed
that she was newly awakened to a sense of power that
she had not known she possessed. If only she could
have read this before she had gone to Paris, what a help
it would have been!</p>

<p>"So Algy was not so ignorant, after all," she mused.
"Of course, he must have thought I was, and so did not
let me see that he himself was more than a fool&mdash;darling
Algy." But, at all events, he had thought she was like
<i>Th&eacute;odore</i>, only kinder&mdash;that was good enough! Well,
she would make that true some day, and meanwhile she
was away from stultifying squalor&mdash;away from minds
only interested in petty local affairs&mdash;away from sham
gentility, away from gramophones and cinemas&mdash;away
from pretence, away among the real things where she
could learn to understand every shade of the meaning
of life step by step! And at this stage of her musings,
after a gentle knock the same housemaid opened the
door with a can of hot water.</p>

<p>"Your dinner will be served in the secretary's room
at eight o'clock, miss; it is half-past seven now. When
would you like me to return to fasten you up?"</p>

<p>The two red spots appeared in Katherine Bush's
cheeks. So she had been expected to change her dress&mdash;and
she had not thought of doing so! She had not
even imagined that she would go again downstairs or
have any dinner after that wonderful tea! A little
supper probably on a tray later on, or something like
that.</p>

<p>But here was dinner! perhaps the same kind of meal
as she had had with Lord Algy. Of course, she ought
to have known that she must change her dress. She
felt very angry with herself, and after the exaltation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
over her own instincts this was a fall! But she would
never err again, and fortunately the housemaid would
not know that she had been ignorant.</p>

<p>"My things fasten in the front, thank you, so that
I need not trouble you," she answered, graciously; "but
will you tell me, please, where I shall find the secretary's
room?"</p>

<p>The housemaid gave directions&mdash;but one of the footmen
would be certain to be in the hall and would show
her. Thomas, the one who had brought her up, would
wait on her.</p>

<p>"When you are ready, miss, will you please ring, and
I will whistle down to say you are coming. We always
did for Miss Arnott, and then they serve the dinner at
once. This bell rings up and this one down; it is the
upstairs one for me. I am Martha, the second housemaid,
miss, and will be pleased to do anything I can
for you."</p>

<p>Katherine Bush thanked the girl again and quickly
began to dress, and at a minute or two to eight was on
her way. This upper staircase she found descended to
the ground floor independently of the stately, shallow
marble one she had walked up on to the sitting-room
on her former visit and which went no farther than
the first floor.</p>

<p>Thomas was waiting for her and conducted her to
a room down the corridor, whose windows she discovered
later looked out on a dull, blank wall. It had comfortable,
solid, leather-covered furniture, the relic possibly
of some country smoking-room, and faded crimson silk
brocade curtains, the discarded splendour of a salon,
perhaps. These were cosily drawn, and there was
plenty of electric light, and she saw that there would
be space to do her typing on the solid, large table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
and to keep all records in those capacious cupboards
which lined the walls. The feeling that she was in
space again gave her satisfaction; she had so often
longed to break down the partition of her attic, or
stretch out and push away the glass screen at Liv and
Dev's. The room was very high, too&mdash;another advantage.</p>

<p>"I shall always have large, high rooms when I have
won my game," she said to herself.</p>

<p>A small table by the fire was laid for one. She made
herself notice the silver and the glass and the cloth, and
almost immediately Thomas brought in a large tray
with her dinner. There was soup in a quaint covered
cup with two handles, and some hot silver dishes.</p>

<p>He placed them all with regularity within her reach,
and then asked respectfully if she would please to ring
when she was ready for her sweet. Miss Arnott was
wont to take claret, he informed her, but what would
she, Miss Bush, desire to drink?</p>

<p>"A cup of tea," almost escaped from the tip of Katherine's
tongue&mdash;but she stopped herself. Probably one
did not take tea with one's dinner even alone like this,
and if she had it, Thomas would know that she was not
accustomed to the regulation things. Water would be
safest. So she indicated her wishes and Thomas left
the room.</p>

<p>A sense of strangeness, almost of awe, stole over her,
a sensation she had not felt even when with Lord Algy
in the gilded luxury of the Paris hotel. She had known
then that those surroundings were just part of any
<i>demi-mondaine's</i> life, and could be had by the lowest
for money&mdash;but these were quite different. These were
rather shabby, but were the expression of people who
had had them for countless years, and were, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
ordinary and everyday in their existences&mdash;the whole
atmosphere affected her.</p>

<p>She was glad that Thomas had gone out of the room.
She knew that at the present stage she should hate to
be watched, while she ate, by a silent servant.</p>

<p>"But I must accustom myself to that," she told herself,
for Algy, she remembered, had never seemed to
remark servants at all, and would go on talking to her,
while his coat was being handed or his boots put on, as
though Hanson did not exist.</p>

<p>She was hungry and began to break her bread. She
wished she felt quite sure whether or no she was expected
to turn the soup out into the soup plate or drink
it as it was? She decided to try the former course,
since of what use was the soup plate if it had not been
brought for that purpose?</p>

<p>The food proved to be excellent; and the sweet and
fruit just to her taste, and when all was finished,
Thomas removed everything and folded up the small
table and put it back into its, evidently, accustomed
corner, and bringing her the evening papers, he made
up the fire and left her alone.</p>

<p>This, she supposed, would be the time she would have
to herself. She hardly noticed the headlines as
she glanced at the news; her mind was too full of herself
and her new life to take interest in outside
things.</p>

<p>Where did that door lead to? she wondered&mdash;a heavy
mahogany door; but she was soon to know, for it
opened suddenly, and the man she had already twice
seen came in, leaving it open after him, so that she
could perceive that the room he had left was a dim,
vast library; it was lined with books.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said. "I have come for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
large-sized paper. My aunt used to have it kept in
this drawer, I think."</p>

<p>Katherine Bush rose while he went to get it out for
himself&mdash;he was not her employer, and she did not yet
know where things were kept, so she did not offer to
help him. He was in evening dress, and his hair
was as well groomed as Lord Algy's, but not cut quite
so short, and it was brushed straight back from his
forehead and was brown and thick. His face was tired
and humorous and very distinguished, but for the moment
he looked cross and impatient. The paper
was evidently not where he had thought that it would
be.</p>

<p>"Confound it!" he muttered, almost inaudibly, and
then aloud, "I am in a great hurry. Will you please
look in those cupboards while I look in these?"</p>

<p>Katherine Bush did as she was asked, and chanced
upon the paper immediately. She handed it to him
without a word. She noticed that he hardly looked at
her, and did not take in her personality at all. She
was just his aunt's new secretary and typist; and more
important matters pressed.</p>

<p>"Thanks, awfully;" then he glanced at the table,
where the typing machine used by Miss Arnott stood.
"Oh!&mdash;er&mdash;I was wondering if you would be so awfully
kind as to type this when I have written it; it is a letter
I must send to the <i>Times</i>, and I shall have to go in to
dinner in a minute.'</p>

<p>"I have not seen how this machine works yet," Katherine
Bush answered, "but if you care to dictate, I can
take it down in shorthand and then write it out very
quickly afterwards."</p>

<p>"That is most kind of you&mdash;will you come into the
library then?&mdash;my notes are there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>She followed him silently, and when he had found
some scribbled words written on the back of an envelope,
he went to the hearth-rug, and, leaning against the
mantelpiece, began to speak. Katherine had taken up
a block and pencil and was waiting ready.</p>

<p>He was not coherent at first; he had neither Mr. Livingstone's
precise, oily slowness, nor Mr. Devereux's
crisp fluency. She took down exactly what he had said.
Then he asked her to read it aloud.</p>

<p>"That is frightful English!" he exclaimed, impatiently.
"I never can dictate properly, I must always
write myself or my ideas do not flow."</p>

<p>"If the substance is all right and it is just the English
you want regulated, I can do that when I copy it
out."</p>

<p>He looked at her in doubt, and Katherine smiled to
herself&mdash;this flattered her.</p>

<p>"It would be awfully kind of you if you would,
though," he went on, hesitatingly. "I have kept them
waiting a quarter of an hour as it is. Could you do it
immediately and send it in to the dining-room by one
of the footmen? I have my fountain-pen with me, I will
sign it there. It is to be addressed to the Editor of the
<i>Times</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will."</p>

<p>Mr. Strobridge thanked his aunt's new secretary
courteously as he went towards the door, and then he
left the room. At the moment of his exit, Katherine
Bush heard the sound of voices, male and female; they
were evidently going in to dinner without waiting for
him. She looked up at the clock, it was ten minutes to
nine; then she smiled again and, going to the writing-table,
she began her task, a very simple one to her who
was accustomed to frame euphonious sentences. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
when she had completed it, she went back into the secretary's
room and rang the bell.</p>

<p>"This is to be taken to Mr.&mdash;is his name Strobridge?&mdash;Lady
Garribardine's nephew," she told the astonished
Thomas.</p>

<p>"Yes, miss. <i>Her Ladyship's</i> nephew is <i>the Honourable</i>
Mr. Gerard Strobridge&mdash;if you mean him."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do&mdash;he is dining here and wants it at once."</p>

<p>She made no further explanation, but took up the
paper and reseated herself in her chair by the fire; and
Thomas could but obey orders.</p>

<p>"A cool card," he whistled to himself, as he disappeared.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Gerard Strobridge was saying to the lady
at his side:</p>

<p>"I had to repudiate Warrington's insolence in the
<i>Central Gazette</i> to-night. I have written to the <i>Times</i>&mdash;that
is what made me keep even you waiting, dearest
lady. My aunt's new shorthand typist took it down,
and I shall send it off in a few minutes. I hope it will
not be too late."</p>

<p>"You look quite serious, G.," the lady laughed. "It
is too attractive to see you in earnest over something!"</p>

<p>"I am always in earnest&mdash;especially when I tell you
that I love you&mdash;why did you not come this afternoon,
L&auml;o, I stayed late on purpose and you never turned
up."</p>

<p>"I knew I should meet you to-night, G.&mdash;and I do
not want soon to grow bored!"</p>

<p>Mr. Strobridge looked at her reproachfully. She
was extremely pleasant to the eye, with her marvellous
skin and dark hair, and her curly affected mouth. He
was a cynic and an epicurean. He was not in the least
disenchanted by his knowledge that the whole woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
was a mass of affectation, from the conscious pouting
of her red lips to the way she held her soup spoon. He
rather admired the skill she showed in it all. She
pleased his senses, had just enough wit to chirp like a
parrot good things others had said, and was full of
small talk&mdash;while she knew the game to her finger-tips.
He did not want the repetition of a serious affair since
he had so happily escaped by the skin of his teeth from
Alice Southerwood. L&auml;o Delemar, widowed and rich
and circumspect, promised an agreeable winter to him,
with few complications.</p>

<p>Women were more or less necessities to Gerard Strobridge's
life; they were his choruses, his solaces, his
inspirations.</p>

<p>In a few minutes a footman brought the large envelope,
and amidst general chaff he read aloud the letter,
his astonishment momentarily growing at the apt rearrangement
of his words.</p>

<p>"She is no fool, your new secretary, Seraphim," he
called down the table to his aunt. "I do thank you for
her services to-night."</p>

<p>Sarah Lady Garribardine laughed complacently.</p>

<p>"I told you, G., I had found a treasure in Miss Katherine
Bush!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>


<p>Over a week had gone by and Katherine Bush had
completely fallen into her duties; they were not
difficult, and she continued to keep her eyes and
her intelligence on the alert, and by the second Sunday
when she was to have the afternoon to meet Matilda,
she had begun to feel that a whole ocean had
rolled between the present Katherine and the creature
of the days before the outing in Paris with Lord
Algy!</p>

<p>She had made one or two annoying mistakes and had
had one or two surprises, some pleasant ones. It was
agreeable to have a cup of tea when one woke, and one's
curtains drawn back by an attentive housemaid every
morning, and a deep hot bath, instead of a scramble in
a small tin tub on Saturday nights. There was a bathroom
in Laburnum Villa, but during the week Matilda
used it for keeping all sorts of things in, and there were
such a number of them to have the bath in turns on Saturday
and Sunday, that Katherine had preferred the
indifferent comfort of a makeshift in her own attic. It
seemed on looking back, after ten days of modest luxury,
that it never could have been possible that she had
gone on month after month, and year after year, in the
family circle.</p>

<p>Her heart swelled with gratitude to Lord Algy; but
for him she might never have known that there was anything
different. At these moments she knew that she
could easily slip into sentiment about him again, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
so she invariably crushed her emotion and began some
active work.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock in the morning it was her duty to go
to Lady Garribardine in her bedroom, where she would
find her propped up upon lacy pink silk pillows, a saucy
cap and ribbons covering the greater part of a more
coquettish and rather lighter golden wig than the one
she wore in the day. Her face had not yet been arranged,
and presented a sad contrast to these youthful
allurements. Her temper was often very precarious.</p>

<p>Katherine stood by the bed, block in hand, and took
down all instructions. Lady Garribardine's voluminous
correspondence was only attended to in the morning;
the accumulations of the later part of the day before
were heaped up in one basket tray, and the early posts
in another. While a third empty one awaited those
communications which were to be answered either in
type or in handwriting.</p>

<p>Now, after ten days of service, Katherine had mastered
most of Lady Garribardine's affairs. She knew
the wages of her servants, the expenditure of the house,
the phrasing of her friends' letters, their points of
views, little hatreds and little loves, their want or possession
of good English and powers of expressing themselves&mdash;she
fancied she could almost picture the faces,
so vivid were these pen portraits of the writers that the
notes showed. Lady Garribardine seldom answered
even the most private with her own hand and Katherine
had grown quite accustomed to signing "Sarah Garribardine"
as "yours affectionately" or "yours sincerely."
She even derived a cynical amusement from the fictions
she was instructed to invent to one and another.</p>

<p>The life of a great lady, she saw, would be a very
complicated affair to a novice, and each day she felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
glad she was having the opportunity of learning its intricacies.
She meant to make no mistakes when her own
turn should come.</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine had not continued to exploit her
for her personal diversion as she had done on the occasion
of their initial meeting, she had been too occupied,
perhaps; on the contrary, she kept strictly to her r&ocirc;le
of employer and hardly spoke except on business.
Katherine realised that she looked upon her much as
Lord Algy had looked upon Hanson, and far from its
arousing the rageful resentment which it would have
done in Matilda's feminine breast, she saw the justice of
it, and considered it a proper arrangement.</p>

<p>"Some people have the luck to be born to high station,"
she reasoned to herself, "and those who would attain
it for themselves must make themselves fitted for
it first&mdash;besides there would be no good in it to me, if
after I had obtained it I should have to hobnob with my
own secretary. It is the distinctions and barriers that
make the thing worth having."</p>

<p>As yet she had only rarely come across other members
of the world beyond her employer on such occasions
as, for instance, if she were sent for suddenly to
the drawing-room to take down some instruction, or
bring some charity list; but whenever she had the chance
she observed them carefully. Some of them were far
from what had been her ideal of what high birth and
breeding would certainly show, but they all had that
ease of manner which polished their casualnesses, and
once she was still receiving instructions by the bedside
when Stirling, the maid, came to know if Lady Beatrice
Strobridge might come up.</p>

<p>"Confound the woman!" Her Ladyship exclaimed in
her angelic voice, its refinement of pronunciation always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
a joy to Katherine's ear&mdash;whatever the bluntness of
the words might be&mdash;"No, certainly not&mdash;my face is not
done&mdash;but stay, Stirling, it may be something to do
with to-night&mdash;give me the rouge and powder and a
looking-glass. Don't go, Miss Bush&mdash;it is nothing private
and she won't stay for more than a minute."</p>

<p>Katherine discreetly turned her eyes from the bed
to the window, and when she looked round again, two
blooming rose-coloured cheeks balanced the girlish
curls, and Lady Garribardine was reposing languidly
upon her pillows.</p>

<p>"Dearest Aunt Sarah, I had to come," cried Lady
Beatrice in her plaintive discontented voice, "Gerard
has been perfectly impossible, actually has refused to
let me go to the Artist Model's ball as Ganymede, and
I have got the most ducky dress, a pendant to Hebe
Vermont's Iris."</p>

<p>"A few rags of chiffon, a cup and bare legs, I suppose,"
Lady Garribardine retorted not unkindly, as her
niece sat upon the bed.</p>

<p>"You may describe it like that if you want to, Aunt
Sarah! I assure you, though, it is most becoming, and
it is too ridiculous when everyone we know is going, and
all the Thorvils have such tiny ankles, too."</p>

<p>"The more reason for you not to expose them to the
common herd. Go naked if you so desire to a ball in a
private house among your own class&mdash;you'll lay yourself
open only to criticisms of your charms there&mdash;but
to let hoi polloi gaze at you undressed is to lower your
order; I am with Gerard about that."</p>

<p>Lady Beatrice pouted.</p>

<p>"I really thought you were so up to date, Aunt Seraphim,
darling, that you would be sure to side with me&mdash;of
course I shall go, all the same; I should not think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
paying any attention to Gerard&mdash;only it would be so
much nicer if you had consented to scold him for me."</p>

<p>"I am up to date, I hope, in so far as I try to move
with the times"&mdash;Lady Garribardine's face was good-naturedly
contemptuous&mdash;"only, I consider that all of
you who throw your bonnets over the windmills are cutting
your own throats&mdash;You are destroying values,
cheapening pleasures, breaking down hedges, and letting
in the swine to feed upon your grapes&mdash;you are
often very vulgar, you modern people."</p>

<p>Lady Beatrice got off the bed.</p>

<p>"Then there is no use talking, Aunt Sarah&mdash;I dare
say we are&mdash;but what matter? I wish I knew what <i>does</i>
matter? I am bored all the time; I get some momentary
pleasure out of my poetry, and some out of my dear
precious friends&mdash;but the rest of the day is one long
yawn. You ought not to grudge my being Ganymede;
every sort of quaint creature is at this ball, and I get
quite amused each year when I go."</p>

<p>"Why don't you take a box, then, and watch them?
I could quite understand that, and intend to do so myself&mdash;Miss
Bush, by the way, did you write to say I
would have number five?"</p>

<p>Katherine replied in the affirmative and Lady Beatrice
suddenly became aware of her presence as she resumed
her place on the bed.</p>

<p>"Oh, this is your new secretary, Aunt Sarah! I am
sure you have a frightfully difficult time&mdash;er&mdash;Miss
Bush!" And she laughed, "Her Ladyship expects perfection."</p>

<p>"Her Ladyship has quite a right to as good as can
be got&mdash;since she pays for it."</p>

<p>Katherine's voice was deep and level, and contained
no impertinence, only a grave statement of fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Garribardine chuckled among her pillows.</p>

<p>"Miss Bush is much nearer the truth of things than
any of you so-called psychological philosophers, Bee&mdash;analysing
matters with little dilettante methods all day
to the laughter of the gods. Miss Bush realises her obligations
as a secretary, but you very often don't perceive
yours as a duke's daughter, and a rising Foreign
Office official's wife."</p>

<p>Lady Beatrice was not the least crushed. She
laughed frankly.</p>

<p>"Dear, sweet Aunty! There never has been a scandal
about me in my life&mdash;I am a model of circumspectness,
demureness and present-day virtuous wifeliness.
Why, I never interfere with Gerard&mdash;we hardly meet in
the whole week&mdash;and I merely like my own simple
friends, my own simple clothes, and my own simple
pleasures!"</p>

<p>"Artless creature!" And the youthful curls shook.
"Well, what did you come for, in so many words? To
try to get me to influence Gerard not to play for once
the ineffectual part of husband in authority, and so let
you disgrace the name of Thorvil and Strobridge in
peace?"</p>

<p>Lady Beatrice seized and stroked the fat hand lying
upon the pink silk coverlet.</p>

<p>"You darling, ducky Aunt Seraphim! Just that! I
want to wear my enchanting boy's dress&mdash;I must be
Ganymede, the cupbearer!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be no party to it&mdash;be off with you. I have
serious affairs to settle with Miss Bush and have no
further time to waste."</p>

<p>Lady Beatrice saluted her obediently and got off the
bed once more; she was laughing softly.</p>

<p>"Gerard is coming to lunch," Lady Garribardine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
called to her, "and L&auml;o Delemar, and they are going to
see a winter exhibition afterwards."</p>

<p>"I can't stand L&auml;o," Lady Beatrice cooed from the
doorway; "she pretends to be so full of sex and other
dreadful natural things, she makes my innocent aesthetic
flesh creep&mdash;Gerard always had fruity tastes&mdash;Bye-bye,
dear Aunt Sarah!" And kissing her finger-tips
she was at last gone, leaving Katherine wondering.</p>

<p>They had said very severe things to each other and
neither was the least angry really&mdash;Gladys and Fred
were not wont to bicker so.</p>

<p>"Call up Mr. Strobridge, Miss Bush&mdash;he will not have
left home yet&mdash;you know his number&mdash;ask him to speak
to me at once."</p>

<p>Katherine obeyed&mdash;she was an expert with the telephone
and never raised her voice. Mr. Strobridge was
soon at the other end of it, and she was about to hand
the receiver to her employer when that lady frowned
and told her to give the message herself.</p>

<p>"My right ear is troublesome to-day," she said, "you
must do the business for me, Miss Bush."</p>

<p>"Hello! Her Ladyship wishes me to give you a message&mdash;will
you wait a moment until I take it?"</p>

<p>"Hello! Yes."</p>

<p>"Say he is to come half an hour earlier to lunch to-day.
I have things to talk over with him about to-night&mdash;He
is to go to this ridiculous ball in my box&mdash;tell
him so."</p>

<p>Katherine repeated the exact message.</p>

<p>"Tell her I am very much annoyed about the whole
thing," Mr. Strobridge returned, "and have decided not
to be present myself."</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense!" cried Lady Garribardine, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
she was told, and, seizing the receiver from Katherine's
hand, she roared:</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, G.&mdash;it is too late in the day to stand
upon your dignity&mdash;I'll tell you the rest when you come
to lunch."&mdash;Upon which she closed the communication
and called for Stirling.</p>

<p>"Take all this rubbish of letters away, Miss Bush&mdash;I
must get up and cope with the humiliating defects of
old age&mdash;you may go."</p>

<p>Katherine had a very busy morning in front of her.
She sat steadily typing and writing in the secretary's
room, until her lunch was brought and even then she
hardly stopped to eat it, but on her own way to the
dining-room Lady Garribardine came in. She looked
at the hardly tasted food and blinked her black eyes:</p>

<p>"Tut, tut! You must eat, child&mdash;<i>pas trop de z&egrave;le</i>&mdash;Finish
your pudding&mdash;and then bring me those two letters
upon the report of the Wineberger charity&mdash;into
the dining-room&mdash;You can have your coffee with us&mdash;Mr.
Strobridge and I are alone, Mrs. Delemar is not
coming, after all&mdash;By the way, do you have everything
you want? The coffee they give you is good, eh?
Servants always skimp the beans when left to themselves."</p>

<p>"I have everything I want, thank you&mdash;but I have
not been offered coffee," Katherine replied.</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine's face assumed an indignant expression,
and she sharply rang the bell.</p>

<p>"These are the things that happen when one does not
know of them&mdash;you ought to have complained to me before,
Miss Bush!"</p>

<p>Thomas answered the bell and whitened perceptibly
when he saw his mistress's face. He was asked why Miss
Bush had not been served with coffee, in a voice which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
froze his tongue, and the only excuse he could give was
a stammering statement that Miss Arnott had not taken
any, which aroused further wrath.</p>

<p>"Pampered wretches!" Lady Garribardine exclaimed.
"Anything to save themselves trouble! I will speak to
Bronson about this&mdash;but see that it never happens
again, Thomas!" And the trembling footman was allowed
to leave the room.</p>

<p>"I am glad you did not try to defend them, as the
foolish Arnott would have done," Her Ladyship flashed.
"She was always standing between my just wrath and
the servant's delinquencies, always shielding them&mdash;one
would have thought she was of their class. The result
was no one in the house respected her&mdash;good creature
though she was. See that you are respected, young
woman, and obeyed when obedience is your due."</p>

<p>"I will try to be"&mdash;and an inscrutable expression
played round Katherine's full red mouth. "I would
never shield anyone from what he deserved."</p>

<p>"It seems to me you understand a good deal, girl!&mdash;Well,
come into the dining-room in half an hour," and,
smiling her comprehending smile, Lady Garribardine
left the room.</p>

<p>"G., that is a wonderful creature, that new secretary
of mine&mdash;have you noticed her yet?" she said later on to
her nephew when they had finished the serious part of
their luncheon, and she had rung her enamelled bell for
the automatic entrance of the servants from behind the
screen&mdash;they were only allowed in the room to change
the courses at this meal. Numbers of politicians and
diplomats frequently dropped in and preferred to discuss
affairs with their hostess alone.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not much," Mr. Strobridge admitted when
they were again by themselves and coffee had come. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
thought she did my letter to the <i>Times</i> remarkably well,
though."</p>

<p>"She has not done anything badly yet&mdash;when she
makes a mistake in social trifles she always realises it,
and corrects herself. Her reading aloud was grotesque
at first, but I have never had to tell her how to pronounce
a word twice. I lay traps for her; she is as
smart as paint and as deep as a well."</p>

<p>"A treasure indeed&mdash;" but Mr. Strobridge's voice
was absent, he was uninterested and was still smarting
under the annoyance of the situation created by his
wife.</p>

<p>Of course he could not make her stay at home by
force&mdash;and he hated the idea of Ganymede and the bare
legs. He reverted to the topic once more.</p>

<p>"I would really rather not go to see the freakish crew
to-night," he said. "Beatrice is doing it merely from
obstinacy; she is not like Hebe Vermont, a ridiculous
<i>poseuse</i>, crazy for notoriety; she is a refined creature
generally, though wearying. This is just to defy me."</p>

<p>"As I have always told you, G., you should never
have married, you are made for an ardent and devoted
lover, with a suitable change of inamorata every six
months. In the r&ocirc;le of husband you are&mdash;frankly&mdash;a
little ridiculous! You have no authority. As Miss
Bush put it just now about something else, you usually
act from good nature, not from a sense of justice; and
Beatrice snaps her fingers at you and goes her own
way."</p>

<p>"I don't mind as a rule&mdash;indeed, I am grateful to her
for doing so. Can there be anything more tedious and
bourgeois than the recognised relation of husband and
wife? The only things which make intimacy with a
woman agreeable are difficulty and intermittency. Bee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
fortunately expects nothing from me, and I expect
nothing from her, beyond acting in a manner suitable
to her race and station, and I don't think Ganymede
in his original costume at an Artist Models' ball a harmonious
part for my wife or a Thorvil to adopt."</p>

<p>"You don't know how to manage her, and you are too
indifferent to try&mdash;so you had better swallow your outraged
dignity and come with me in my box after all.
L&auml;o will be there and you can sit and whisper in the
back of it." And Lady Garribardine lit her cigarette,
but Mr. Strobridge protested in whimsical distress:</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid! Would you kill this dawning romance,
Seraphim? If L&auml;o and I are to be drafted off
like a pair of fianc&eacute;s, the whole charm is gone. I wish
to <i>m&eacute;nager</i> my emotions so that they may last over the
Easter recess; after that I shall be too busy for them
to matter. Don't be ruthless, sweet Aunt!"</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine laughed and at that moment
Katherine Bush came in, the finished letters in her hand.</p>

<p>"Give Miss Bush some coffee, G., while I look over
them," and Her Ladyship indicated the tray which had
been placed by an attentive Bronson close to her hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Strobridge did as he was asked. His thoughts
were far away, and beyond displaying the courtesy he
used to all women, he never noticed Katherine at all.
She was quite ordinary looking still&mdash;with the screwed
up mop of ashen-hued hair, and her plain dark blouse,
unless you chanced to meet her strange and beautiful
eyes.</p>

<p>For some reason she felt a little piqued, the man's
manner and phrasing attracted her, his voice was
superlatively cultivated, and his words chosen with polished
grace. Here was a person from whom something
could be learned. She would have wished to have talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
with him unrestrainedly and alone. She remained silent
and listened when aunt and nephew again took up the
ball of conversation together. How she would love to
be able to converse like that! They were so sparkling&mdash;never
in earnest seemingly, all was light as air,
while Mr. Strobridge made allusions and quotations
which showed his brilliant erudition, and Katherine
hearkened with all her ears. Some of them she recognized
and others she determined to look up, but his
whole pronunciation of the sentences sounded different
from what she had imagined they would be when she
had read them to herself.</p>

<p>This was the first time she had heard a continued
conversation between two people who she had already
decided were worthy of note, and this half-hour stood
out as the first milestone in her progress.</p>

<p>Presently they all rose&mdash;and she went back to her
work with the sense of the magnitude of her task in
climbing to the pinnacle of a great lady and cultivated
woman of the world.</p>

<p>For a few moments she felt a little depressed&mdash;then
a thought came to her.</p>

<p>"He could help me to knowledge of literature and
art&mdash;he could teach me true culture&mdash;and since he is
married there can be no stupid love-making. But for
this he must first realise that I exist and for that when
my chance comes I must arrest his attention through
the ears and the eyes. He must for once look at me
and see not only his aunt's secretary&mdash;and then I can
learn from him all that I desire to know."</p>

<p>That this course of action could possibly cause the
proposed teacher pain in the future never entered her
head.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>


<p>Matilda had been told to meet her sister, if it
should be fine on this Sunday, in the Park by
the Serpentine; they would walk about and
then go and have an early tea at Victoria Station,
whence Matilda could take a train back to Bindon's
Green.</p>

<p>They met punctually at the time appointed on the
bridge, and the elder Miss Bush was filled with joy.
She had missed Katherine dreadfully, as browbeating
husbands are often missed by meek wives, and she was
full of curiosity to hear her news.</p>

<p>"You look changed somehow, Kitten!" she exclaimed,
when they had greeted each other. "It isn't because
you'd done your hair differently; you had it that way
on the last day&mdash;it isn't a bit 'the look', but it suits
you. No, it's not that&mdash;but you are changed somehow.
Now tell me everything, dearie&mdash;I am dying to
hear."</p>

<p>"I like it," began Katherine, "and I am learning lots
of things."</p>

<p>This information did not thrill Matilda. Katherine's
desire to be always learning was very fatiguing, she
thought, and quite unnecessary. She wanted to hear
facts of food and lodging and people and treatment,
not unimportant moral developments.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;well," she said. "Are they kind to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I am waited on like a lady&mdash;and generally
the work isn't half so heavy as at Liv and Dev's."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me right from the beginning. What you
do when you get up in the morning until you go to
bed."</p>

<p>Katherine complied.</p>

<p>"I am waked at half-past seven and given a cup of
tea&mdash;real tea, Tild, not the stuff we called tea at home."
(A slight toss of the head from Matilda.) "The second
housemaid waits on me, and pulls up my blind, and
then I have my bath in the bathroom across the passage&mdash;a
nice, deep hot bath."</p>

<p>"Whatever for&mdash;every day?" interrupted Matilda.
"What waste of soap and towels and things&mdash;do you
like it, Kitten?"</p>

<p>"Of course, I do&mdash;we all seem to be very dirty people
to me now, Tild&mdash;with our one tub a week; you soon
grow to find things a necessity. I could not bear not
to have a bath every day now."</p>

<p>Matilda snorted.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;and then&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Then I go down and have my breakfast in the secretary's
room&mdash;my sitting-room, in fact. It is a lovely
breakfast, with beautiful china and silver and table-linen,
and when I have finished that I take my block
and pencil and go up to Lady Garribardine's bedroom
to take down my instructions for the day in shorthand."</p>

<p>"Oh, Kitten, do tell me, what's her room like?" At
last something interesting might be coming!</p>

<p>"It is all pink silk and lace and a gilt bed, and numbers
of photographs, and a big sofa and comfortable
chairs&mdash;and when she has rheumatism she stays there
and has people up to tea."</p>

<p>"What! Folks to tea in her bedroom? Ladies, of
course?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! dear no! Men, too! She has heaps of men
friends; they are devoted to her."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen in her bedroom! I do call that fast!"
Matilda was frankly shocked.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Katherine.</p>

<p>"Why? My dear! Just fancy&mdash;gentlemen where
you sleep and dress! Mabel would not dream of doing
such a thing&mdash;and I do hope she'll never hear you are
in that kind of a house. She'd be sure to pass remarks."</p>

<p>"Lady Garribardine is over sixty years old, Tild!
Don't you think you are being rather funny?" and
Katherine wondered why she had never noticed before
that Matilda was totally devoid of all sense of humour.
And then she realised that the conception was
new even to herself, and must have come from her book
reading, though she was conscious that it was a gift
that she had always enjoyed. No one had spoken of
the "senses of humour" in their home circle, and Matilda
would not have understood what it meant or
whether she did or did not possess it!</p>

<p>Things were things to Matilda, and had not different
aspects, and for a lady to receive gentlemen in her bedroom
if she were even over sixty years old and suffering
from rheumatism was not proper conduct, and
would earn the disapproval of Mabel Cawber and, indeed,
of refined and select Bindon's Green in general.</p>

<p>"I don't see that age makes a difference; it's the idea
of tea in a bedroom, dearie&mdash;with gentlemen!"</p>

<p>"But what do you think they would do to her, Tild?"
Katherine with difficulty hid her smile.</p>

<p>"Oh! my! what dreadful things you do say, Katherine!"
Matilda blushed. "Why, it's the awkwardness
of it for them&mdash;I'm wondering whatever Fred and Bert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
and Charlie Prodgers would feel if Mabel had them up
to hers of a Sunday, supposing she had a cold&mdash;and
what <i>would</i> anyone say!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure Bindon's Green would talk its head
off, and Fred and Bert and Charlie Prodgers would be
awfully uncomfortable and get every sort of extraordinary
idea into their heads, and if a person like Mabel
did do such a thing, as to have them up there, she
would be fidgety herself&mdash;or she would be really fast
and intend them to go ahead. But Lady Garribardine
is always quite sure of herself, and her friends are, too,
and they don't have to consider convention&mdash;they are
really gentlemen, you see, and not worried at all as to
what others think or say, and it seems quite natural
to them to come up and see an old rheumatic lady anywhere
they want to see her. That is just the difference
in the class, Tild&mdash;the upper are perfectly real, and
don't pretend anything, and aren't uncomfortable in
doing natural things."</p>

<p>Matilda was still disapproving, and at once became
antagonistic when her sister made reflections upon
class.</p>

<p>"I call it very queer, anyway," she sniffed. "And
wherever do they find room to sit&mdash;in a bedroom,
dearie?"</p>

<p>Katherine laughed&mdash;she wondered if she had never
had a glimpse of life and space and comfort with Lord
Algy, should she, too, have been as ignorant and surprised
at everything in her new sphere as Matilda was at the
description of it. She supposed she would have
been equally surprised, but would certainly have viewed
it with an open mind. After ten days of peeps at a
world where everything new and old was looked at and
discussed with the broadest toleration, the incredible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
narrowness of the Bindon's Green outlook appalled her&mdash;the
forces of ignorance and prejudice and ridiculous
hypocrisy which ruled such hundreds of worthy people's
lives!</p>

<p>She came back from these speculations to the reality
of her sister's voice, reiterating her question as to
where the visitors found place, and she answered, still
smiling:</p>

<p>"It is a great big room, Tild, twice as big as the
drawing-room at home&mdash;no&mdash;bigger still, and twenty
people could sit in it without crowding."</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious!" ejaculated Matilda; "it must
be grand."</p>

<p>"You see, you are such an old goose, Matilda. You
think the whole world must be like Bindon's Green,
although I have told you over and over again that
other places, and other grades of life, are different,
but you and Mabel and Fred and Bert, and the whole
crew of you, measure everything with your own tiny
measure. You make me gasp at your outlook sometimes."</p>

<p>Matilda bridled&mdash;and Katherine went on.</p>

<p>"Lady Garribardine's house does not seem to be a
bit grand to her, nor to any of the people who come
there. They are not conscious of it; it is just everyday
to them, although some of them live in quite small
houses themselves and aren't at all rich. She has two
cousins&mdash;elderly ladies, who live in a tiny flat&mdash;but oh!
the difference in it to Mabel's villa! I had to take them
a message last week and waited in their mite of a drawing-room&mdash;it
was exquisitely clean and simple, and they
are probably poorer than we are."</p>

<p>Matilda felt too ruffled to continue this conversation;
she always hated the way Katherine argued with her;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
she wanted to get back to the far more interesting subject
of carpets and curtains and arrangements in the
rooms of Lady Garribardine's house. Numbers of the
people in her serials, of course, were supposed to own
such places, and she had often seen bits of them on the
stage, but until she found Katherine really lived now
in one, somehow she had never believed in them as living
actualities, or rather their reality had not been
brought home to her. So she questioned Katherine,
and soon had an accurate description of her ladyship's
bedroom, and the rest of the house, then she got back
to the happenings of her sister's day.</p>

<p>"Well, when you have got up there, you take down
orders, and then?"</p>

<p>"I sort everything that has come by the post and
mark on the envelopes how I am to answer them, and I
sometimes read her the papers aloud if her eyes are
tired."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"And then I go down and write the letters; she
hardly ever answers any herself, and I have to write
them as if I were she. Her friends must wonder how
her hand and style have changed since Miss Arnott
left!"</p>

<p>Here was something thrilling again for Matilda.</p>

<p>"Oh, my! What a lot you must get to know about
the smart set, Kitten; isn't it interesting!"</p>

<p>"Yes, as I told you, I am learning lessons."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother that! Well, what do they write about,
do tell me&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"All sorts of things; their movements, their charities&mdash;invitations,
little witticisms about each other&mdash;politics,
the last good story&mdash;and, some of them,
books."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you have to answer as if you were her? However
do you do it, Kitten?"</p>

<p>"She gives me the general idea&mdash;she showed me the
first time for the private letters, and now I know, but
sometimes perhaps I write as if it were me!"</p>

<p>"And don't they know it is not her hand?"</p>

<p>"Of course, but they don't care. She is a great lady
and a character, and she is very powerful in their circle
of society, and it is worth everyone's while to be civil to
her."</p>

<p>"It is all funny. Well, what else do you do?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes I have to do errands&mdash;shopping and so
on&mdash;and then my luncheon comes&mdash;the food is lovely,
and I am waited on by a footman called Thomas; he is
the third; and on Wednesday Lady Garribardine took
his and the butler's heads off because I had not been
given coffee. She means me to be perfectly treated, I
can tell you!"</p>

<p>"Coffee after your lunch, how genteel! And my!
what a lot of servants. Whatever do they all do?"</p>

<p>"Their work, I suppose. You forget it is a big
house and everything is splendidly done and beautifully
clean, and regular and orderly."</p>

<p>Here Matilda insisted upon a full list of all the retainers,
and an account of their separate duties; her
domestic soul revelled in these details, and at the end
of the recital her awe knew no bounds. Katherine was
able to give her a very circumstantial set of statements,
as all accounts passed through her hands.</p>

<p>"Well, your old lady must spend pints of money,"
Matilda said, with a sigh, "but we've not got to your
afternoons yet, dearie. Do you work all them, too?"</p>

<p>"When I am very busy&mdash;it depends how much I have
to do; if I am not very occupied and I have not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
out in the morning, I go for a walk before tea. I have
to take her ladyship's two fox-terriers, Jack and Joe;
they are jolly little fellows, and I love them. We
scamper in the square, or go as far as the Park."</p>

<p>"And your tea? They bring you up a cup, I suppose,
every day&mdash;regular?"</p>

<p>"Not a cup&mdash;a whole tray to myself, and lovely muffins
and cream, Tild. Lady Garribardine has a Jersey
herd of cows at her place in Blankshire, and the cream
comes up each day from there."</p>

<p>"My! how nice!" Matilda sighed again. Her imagination
could hardly take in such luxury. It seemed
to her that Katherine must be living in almost gilded
vice!</p>

<p>"Then after tea, if I am not sent for to do any special
thing, I read to myself. I look up anything that
I don't know about that I have chanced to hear spoken
of by the people who come&mdash;I am allowed to take books
from the library."</p>

<p>"Then you do see people sometimes?" Matilda's interest
revived again. "What are they like, Kitten?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes I do, but not often&mdash;only when I chance
to be sent for, but next week Her Ladyship has got a
big charity tableaux entertainment on hand, that she
is arranger and patroness of, and I shall come across
lots of people of society, some of the ones you know
the names of so well in the <i>Flare</i>."</p>

<p>"The Duchess of Dashington and the Countess of
Blanktown&mdash;really, Kitten!"</p>

<p>This was fashion, indeed!</p>

<p>"Probably&mdash;but I don't know about the Duchess of
Dashington. I don't think Lady Garribardine approves
of her."</p>

<p>"Not approve of the Duchess of Dashington!" Matilda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
exclaimed, indignantly. "Her that has gentlemen
to tea in her bedroom to give herself airs like that!
Well, I never!"</p>

<p>This particular Duchess' photographs were the joy
of the halfpenny illustrated papers, and Matilda was
accustomed to see her in skating costume waltzing with
her instructor, and in golf costume and in private theatrical
costumes, almost every other week.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;she speaks of her very cheaply&mdash;but I will tell
you all about it on Sunday fortnight. I'll have heard
everything by then, because the tableaux will be
over."</p>

<p>Matilda returned to her muttons.</p>

<p>"Then you have supper, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I go up and dress myself and put on my best
blouse and have my dinner at eight o'clock; after that
I generally read the paper or French books&mdash;and at
ten I go to bed."</p>

<p>"Gracious! what's the good of dressing if you don't
see anyone? How you'll use up your blouse!"</p>

<p>Matilda was aghast at such folly!</p>

<p>"I am supposed to be a lady, Tild, and a lady is expected
to dress in the evening if she is alone on a desert
island."</p>

<p>"What stuff! Whatever for?"</p>

<p>"Self-respect."</p>

<p>"Fiddlesticks."</p>

<p>Presently Katherine grew reflective, her catechism
over. "I wish you could see it all, Tild; it would enlarge
your brain&mdash;it is all so different from Bindon's
Green. If you could only hear their point of view, I
assure you, dear, it might be two different nations&mdash;those
barefoot urchins climbing on the rails are much
nearer their level than we are."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>But Matilda could not stand this; her wrath rose.</p>

<p>"Those dirty boys nearer your new people than a
real lady like Mabel Cawber, and your own brothers
and sisters! Katherine, how dare you! Horrid little
guttersnipes with no pride of themselves; why, they
aren't even ashamed to be here of a Sunday among decent
people&mdash;they'd do anything!"</p>

<p>"That is just it, Tild&mdash;so would the aristocrats if
they wanted to, and wouldn't be a bit ashamed or even
think of it, and they have 'no pride of themselves,'
either&mdash;but you'll never understand, Tild, not if you
live to be a hundred years old."</p>

<p>"And I don't want to, there!"</p>

<p>"Then it is perfectly useless my talking, I see that.
We had better go and have some tea."</p>

<p>And so they turned out of Albert Gate and walked
to Victoria.</p>

<p>Matilda, when she had smoothed her ruffled feelings,
began now to relate the home news. Gladys and her
fianc&eacute; were not happy together; they had not been so
since that visit which Katherine would remember they
had taken to Brighton to stay with his aunt&mdash;it was
nearly six weeks ago now and both grew more and more
gloomy.</p>

<p>"And so uppy as Glad is with Fred, too, and never
a bit back on Bob Hartley!"</p>

<p>Matilda felt things would be better for her sister if
a little more spirit were shown. Mabel and her betrothed
had been up for church parade as usual in the
Park that morning, and this lady had also supped with
them at Laburnum Villa the night before, and they had
had oysters and a jolly time.</p>

<p>Katherine felt a strange emotion when she heard of
this. She seemed to see a picture of Lord Algy enjoying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
oysters, and all the reflections this action had called
up&mdash;oh! how long ago it all appeared!</p>

<p>"And have you met that gentlemen you spoke of?"
Matilda asked, before they parted at the station.</p>

<p>"Mr. Strobridge, you mean&mdash;Lady Garribardine's
nephew. Yes&mdash;he is husband of the lady Glad dresses,
the one who had the model she wanted me to have. He
is a clever man&mdash;we have not really spoken yet, but I
mean to know him very well some day."</p>

<p>"Oh! Kitten, do be careful! And him a married man,
too!"</p>

<p>"For what I want of him, it does not matter whether
he is married or single," Katherine reassured her, and
soon the train moved off.</p>

<p>How good Matilda was! Katherine thought, as she
walked briskly back to Berkeley Square&mdash;an unselfish,
worthy, honest, hopelessly stupid creature, whom somehow
she was fond of. But what could it be that made
her herself so utterly different from them all? Nothing
could be chance&mdash;everything had its reason, only we
were generally too blind to perceive it. So was there
some truth in that vague story of the great-grandmother
having been someone of high family fallen low
in the world and married to the auctioneer great-grandfather,
whom her own father remembered very well?
Could it be that some drop of gentle blood flowed in her
veins, transmitted from this source and concentrated in
her, having escaped the others&mdash;or was it simply from
the years of her reading that her mind had developed?
But it could not be altogether that, because she remembered
instincts and tastes in uneducated early
childhood completely aloof from the family's.</p>

<p>"Father gave me this business capacity," she mused,
"but something beyond must have given me this will to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
achieve&mdash;and I <i>shall</i> achieve&mdash;all I desire&mdash;in time!
Only I must be ruthless and have no emotions. I must
follow what Bacon asserts about great spirits," and she
quoted softly: "'There is not one that hath been transported
to the mad degree of love, which shows that
great spirits and great business do keep out this weak
passion.'"</p>

<p>Yes, she would keep out this weak passion! She had
tasted its joys, and that memory must last her a lifetime.</p>

<p>On the doorstep she encountered Gerard Strobridge
just coming out&mdash;he raised his hat and said politely
that it was an abominably cold day&mdash;then he passed
on down the steps and so towards Hill Street.</p>

<p>And Katherine Bush went up to her room.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>


<p>The week of the tableaux had come and gone, and
had opened yet another window for Katherine
Bush to peep at the world from. She already
knew many of the people who came to the luncheons
and rehearsals, from their letters, and now she judged
of them face to face. She had been in great request
to take down innumerable orders, and arrange business
details, and had listened and inwardly digested what she
heard.</p>

<p>Her contempt for some of the company was as great
as for Miss Mabel Cawber&mdash;she discovered a few with
titles and positions who were what she disdainfully
dubbed, "Middle class underneath!"</p>

<p>"Only that they have been more used to things, they
are as paltry as Mabel," she said to herself, and set
about, as was her custom, to find out why&mdash;and from
what families they had sprung&mdash;and obtained some satisfaction
in the confirmation of her theory of heredity,
in discovering that most of these could lay small claim
to blueness of blood. The insolence of others she approved
of.</p>

<p>Many of the American peeresses who were posing as
queens, and nuns, and Greek goddesses, she truly admired&mdash;they
must have been at one time like herself&mdash;out
to learn&mdash;and now were conscious that they had
made good.</p>

<p>"But I mean to have more repose of manner when I
am there," she told herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Of Sarah Lady Garribardine's sayings and views,
she kept a great store in her mind. This was a real
aristocrat she felt. A human, faulty, strong woman,
incapable of meanness or anything which could lower
the flag of her order. She was supremely insolent, too,
but then she never did anything which could impair
people's respect.</p>

<p>She was hard and generous&mdash;and acted up to the
doctrine that "<i>noblesse oblige</i>" and entirely believed in
the divine right of kings and of Sarah Lady Garribardine!
She had not been a thirteenth century
Baron's daughter for nothing! Katherine Bush shared
every one of Her Ladyship's views and moulded all
her ideals upon them.</p>

<p>Each day she was enlarging her vocabulary of words
to use&mdash;adapting sentences which she had read of fine
English to modern requirements, pruning colloquialisms,
cultivating pronunciation, polishing her critical
faculties. She was perfectly conscious that she had
often employed homely phrases in the past, and had
not always paid enough attention to grammar in speaking,
though for some time she had not used "whatever
for," or "of a Sunday," as poor Matilda always did.</p>

<p>She learned as much comparatively of the general
world of society in that one week, as she had learned
of the nature of man in her three days with Lord Algy.
He was her first step&mdash;these women were her second.
Lady Garribardine was her head master, and Gerard
Strobridge should be her tutor&mdash;when the moment she
was ready for him came.</p>

<p>Her suspicions as to her employer's disapproval of
the Duchess of Dashington were realised fully one day,
in the beginning of the week. The poor young-old lady's
rheumatism was very painful, and she remained in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
room having her favourite nephew and Mrs. Delemar
up with her there to lunch, on a little table close to her
gilt bed.</p>

<p>Katherine was writing at an escritoire near, having
finished her own meal downstairs.</p>

<p>"You need not go, Miss Bush, if you can continue
those invitations with our chatter."</p>

<p>So Katherine stayed.</p>

<p>The three talked of many things at first and Katherine
hardly noticed them, but presently her attention
was caught by a name. Mr. Strobridge was saying:</p>

<p>"Seraphim, it will be very difficult to refuse Dulcie
Dashington, she has written to Beatrice this morning&mdash;she
is quite determined to play the part of Nell Gwyn
as the orange-girl."</p>

<p>"Then she can play it in some other <i>tableaux
vivants</i>&mdash;but not in these that I am arranging." Her
Ladyship's voice was acid.</p>

<p>"But why, dearest Sarah, are you so down on poor
Dulcie?" Mrs. Delemar protested. "She is really a very
good sort, and looks so splendid in these short-skirted,
rather common clothes."</p>

<p>"I am not hard on her, L&auml;o; I am sure, had she been
the wife of a jolly young stockbroker addicted to low
practical jokes and rowdy sport, she would have been
a most admirable creature. It is not the woman I am
down on; there is just such another at Blissington, she
helps me with the bazaars and the school treats, her
husband is a local brewer, and we are capital friends.
It is the Duchess of Dashington I ostracise, as I consider
she has done more to degrade her order in these
socialistic days than any other member of our sadly
humbled peerage."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>The other two laughed amusedly, but Lady Garribardine
went on, raising her voice a little. It was a
subject upon which she felt so deeply, that it overcame
for the moment her usual dryly humorous handling of
any matter.</p>

<p>"Let her have her lovers&mdash;we have all had lovers&mdash;No
one in the least objects to them, arranged suitably,
and of one's own class. I am not concerned with her
or any other woman's physical morality.&mdash;Such morality
is a question of temperament and geography and
custom&mdash;but I am profoundly concerned to endeavour
to keep up some semblance of dignity in the aristocracy,
and Dulcie Dashington has lowered the whole
prestige of Duchesses because she is of gentle birth&mdash;though
Heaven knows what her father was with poor
dear Susan's irresponsible ways!"</p>

<p>Gerard Strobridge smiled as he lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"There is a great deal in what you say, Seraphim;
she has certainly dragged the title down a good deal,
with her fancies for professional gamesters of all sorts
for friends, and her total disregard of tradition at
Dashington&mdash;but you forget that she has had a good
deal to put up with from Toni, who is an impossible
husband."</p>

<p>"No man is an impossible husband if he is a Duke;
at least no Duchess ought to find him so&mdash;and if he
were, that is not the slightest excuse. When a woman
undertakes a great position she should realise that personal
feelings have ceased to count. She has, so to
speak, accepted the responsibility of guarding the
safety of an order, just as a sentry is responsible when
he is on duty. He would be shot in war time if he fell
asleep on duty&mdash;however pitiful his case might be from
hardship and want of rest. He would be shot as an
example to the others not to allow even nature to overcome
them and endanger the post."</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>
<p>"It seems very cruel," piped Mrs. Delemar.</p>

<p>"Not at all!" Lady Garribardine flashed while her
voice vibrated with scorn. "We are at war now with
the Radical masses and cannot afford to jeopardise
positions&mdash;either keep up prestige, or throw up the
game and let the whole thing go by the board, but while
we pretend there is still an aristocracy in England we,
the members of it, should defend it. Dulcie Dashington
and her ways and her photographs in the papers, and
her vulgarity, and the flaunting of her unsavoury domestic
affairs, are a byword and as long as I have a
voice in society, and can lay some claim to power, I
shall let it be known what my opinion is, and why I
will not receive her. To me there is no sin like betraying
an order."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are quite right," Mrs. Delemar now
agreed meekly, "but there are such lots of odd people
in society who do unheard-of things; it is these boys
marrying these wretched actresses or Americans which
has changed everything."</p>

<p>"Not at all!" contradicted her ladyship. "Boys have
always married actresses from time to time, and some
of them have proved very decent creatures, and if they
do err, what does it matter? No one expects better
from them, they are making no real breach in the wall.&mdash;And
as for Americans, they are often very pretty and
so clever that they seldom disgrace their new station;
they are like converts to Rome, more zealous than the
born papists. The only evil which can lie at their door
is that they have too much money, and have given false
values to entertaining, and perhaps have encouraged
eccentric amusements.&mdash;No, my dear child, it is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
English-women themselves who have lost self-respect,
and have lowered the flag, and when one of really high
birth does it, like Dulcie Dashington, she should be
made to pay the price."</p>

<p>This was unanswerable, Katherine Bush thought as
she listened, and she wondered why the other two should
chaff lightly, as though it were just one of Lady Garribardine's
notions. That is what generally astonished
her a good deal; no one appeared to have any convictions
or enthusiasm, they seemed to her to be a company
of drifters, so little energy appeared to be shown
by any of them. They were unpunctual and unpractical,
but they were amusing and deliciously happy-go-lucky.
If they had any real feelings none appeared
upon the surface; even Lady Beatrice and her coterie
of highly evolved poetesses and other artistic worldings,
flew from theme to theme, turning intent faces upon
new fads each week.</p>

<p>Most people's manners were casual, and their attitudes,
too, would often have shocked Mabel Cawber,
so far were they from being genteel. The few who truly
fulfilled Katherine Bush's ideas of the meaning of the
word "lady" stood out like stars. But with all these
flaws, as a collection of people, there was that ease of
manner, that total absence of self-consciousness, about
them which never could be known at Bindon's Green.</p>

<p>"I suppose times are changed," Katherine told herself,
"and the laxity is producing a new type&mdash;I do
wonder how they would all behave if some cataclysm
happened again, like the French Revolution. But when
my day comes I mean to uphold the order which I shall
join, as Her Ladyship does."</p>

<p>At the last moment, Lady Beatrice did not go as
Ganymede to the Artist Models' ball. The history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
her alteration of character was a rather bitterly humorous
story for Gerard Strobridge's ears. She had been
trying on the dress when a note had arrived with a
parcel for her from her husband's aunt, which contained
a very beautiful Greek mantle with these few
words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<i>Dear Child</i>,
</p>

<p>I send you this mantle which I hope you will wear; it
will not really spoil the character of your Ganymede dress,
and from the back it will hide the fact that your legs are
very slightly bowed. Your charming face will help to distract
eyes from the front view, and this very small flaw in
your anatomy will pass unnoticed.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">
Affectionately yours,<br />
<span class="smcap">Sarah Garribardine</span>.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>She had written it with her own hand. Lady Beatrice
stamped with rage, and then flew to her looking-glass.
She stood this way and that, and finally came to the
conclusion that there might be the faintest substratum
of truth in the accusation. The rest of the limbs were
not so perfect as her tiny ankles. It would not be safe
to risk criticism. So the costume was altered and became
a Flora with garlands of roses and long diaphanous
draperies&mdash;and Gerard and Lady Garribardine
watched her entry with the Vermont party with relieved
eyes, and the wily aunt said:</p>

<p>"You can achieve the impossible with women, G., if
you only appeal to, or wound, their vanity. You must
never give orders to one unless she is in love with you&mdash;then
she glories in obedience&mdash;but a modern wife can
only be controlled either on the principle of the Irish-man's
pig being driven towards Dublin when it was
intended for Cork, or by a Machiavellian manipulation
of her self-love."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"And then the game is not worth the candle," Mr.
Strobridge sighed with a little discouragement. "I
wonder, Seraphim, what is worth while? Striving for
the infinite, I suppose&mdash;certainly the finite things are
but Dead Sea fruit."</p>

<p>"Gerard, my poor boy, you make me fear, when you
talk like that, that one day you will be profoundly in
love!"</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid!&mdash;It would upset my digestion. I
was thirty-five last month and have to be careful!"</p>

<p>And in her comfortable bed in Berkeley Square,
Katherine Bush read "The Letters of Lady Mary
Wortley Montagu" far into the night.</p>

<p>Society had not altered in many respects since these
hundred and sixty odd years ago, she thought!</p>

<p>The tableaux were the greatest success and a large
sum of money was secured for one of Lady Garribardine's
pet charities.</p>

<p>Time went on, Christmas was approaching. It was
to be spent at Blissington Court, the place Lady Garribardine
had inherited with the barony of d'Estaire from
her father. Garribardine was a Scotch title while her
ladyship was rabidly English. They would go down to
Blissington and have a family party. Her three grandchildren
(her daughter, Lady Mereton, was far away,
the bored wife of a Colonial Governor), Gerard Strobridge
and perhaps Lady Beatrice and the two old
cousins with a young niece of theirs, and a stray man
or two, and Mrs. Delemar&mdash;but no one could be sure
who would turn up at the end. Katherine was not to
have any holiday; she had come too recently, her employer
explained to her, and the Christmas accumulations
were quite beyond her power to tackle alone.</p>

<p>Katherine was grateful&mdash;she looked forward to seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
this country home with pleasure. She had been
kept unusually busy and so had very rarely seen any
one except Her Ladyship. But one morning about ten
days before they were to go down into Blankshire, Lady
Garribardine informed her secretary she was to be given
for the whole afternoon to Mr. Strobridge to type a
quantity of letters about a new charity he was arranging
for her.</p>

<p>"My nephew dictates abominably, but he said that
you had understood him so well that first evening when
you arrived a month ago, that he has asked me to lend
you to him to-day for this business, and I have consented.
He will lunch here, so have plenty of paper
ready for the afternoon." Then as Katherine was
leaving the room, she handed her a ten-pound note.</p>

<p>"Here is a little present for you, Miss Bush, for
Christmas; I want you to buy yourself an evening frock&mdash;you
must dine with us on Christmas Day and perhaps
you had not provided for this possibility. I am very
pleased with you, girl&mdash;you work splendidly."</p>

<p>Katherine coloured to the roots of her ashen-hued,
glistening hair. She could not analyse her emotions.
She hated presents, and yet she was gratified at the
kindliness and appreciation which lay in the manner
of the gift.</p>

<p>"Your Ladyship is too good," she said very low. "I
have simply done my duty&mdash;but I will endeavour to
buy something suitable with the money which is far
more than enough."</p>

<p>The old lady looked at her critically with her head
a little on one side&mdash;she understood what the blush
had arisen from and she appreciated the pride in the
girl.</p>

<p>"The creature must have some breeding in her some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>where
in spite of the auctioneer parentage. I must talk
to her when we get to Blissington. She may prove a
great interest for my old age."</p>

<p>But she said aloud:</p>

<p>"Well, get what you like with it. I leave it to you,
your taste is excellent&mdash;and while you are out, pay
these two bills for me, and take a little walk&mdash;you have
been looking rather pale; I fear you have not taken
enough outdoor exercise lately."</p>

<p>Katherine thanked her and went rapidly to her room,
a sense of excitement and anticipation in her heart.
This might prove an interesting afternoon. There she
reviewed her wardrobe. Her "dressy" blouse from Oxford
Street was too ornate for the daytime, and she
thought now in rather bad taste, and her morning ones
were too dowdy. This was a great occasion and one
which she had been waiting for. She was to go home
late on this Friday to stay the night at Bindon's Green.
Matilda had insisted upon it, because it was her birthday;
she would be thirty years old. She had been
quite tearful about it on the second occasion on which
she had met her sister in the Park.</p>

<p>"You need not cast us all off like this, Kitten," she
pleaded, "and we shall have Mabel and a few other
friends on Friday night, and Fred has given us a lot
of lovely new nigger song records for the gramophone,
and it will all be so awfully jolly."</p>

<p>So Katherine had promised to go, and this fell in
admirably with her plans. There would be a real excuse
for her to have her hair waved. She had been
given the evening off and it was known that she was
going home. She would consult Gladys again for the
frock for Christmas night and buy what was necessary
on her way back to Berkeley Square on the morrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the first time in her life that a hairdresser
had ever touched her thick mop of hair, and she had
no idea of the difference to her appearance that it
would make. But so critical and observant of all things
had become her eye that she realised with her first peep
in the mirror, when the ondulation was complete, that
it had turned her into almost a beauty. The broad
waves fell back from the parting and showed the admirable
planting of her brow and the Greek setting of
her magnetic eyes. She allowed no elaboration of
fashion, but had her ample tresses bound tightly to
her head&mdash;the effect was distinguished and gave her
satisfaction. Then from the hairdresser's she went
and bought another blouse&mdash;something pale grey and
becoming, and with the parcel she got back to Berkeley
Square in good time for luncheon and began to
dress herself.</p>

<p>She was glad her hands were so white, she had lately
taken to giving great care to the polish of her nails&mdash;she
wished her feet were smaller, but they were well
shaped and no one's feet were really small nowadays,
Lady Garribardine had said!</p>

<p>She was quite content with the picture she saw in
her looking-glass before she went downstairs. It was
of a tall, slim girl with a very white, smooth face&mdash;extraordinary
eyes under level, dark brows, and a big
red mouth, and hair of silvery fairness that glistened
grey, not gold, in its lights. She knew very well that
she was attractive, and gave one of her rare soft laughs.</p>

<p>A month and more of mental discipline and acute
observation of those in that status of refinement to
which she wished to attain had given her numerous
subtle distinctions of manner which she had not
possessed before. She looked like a lady, and felt that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
she was approaching the time when she herself&mdash;most
severe of all critics&mdash;might consider herself to be one.
She was nearly as excited as on that afternoon when
she had left Livingstone and Devereux's to go on a three
days' honeymoon with Lord Algy. She made herself
eat her luncheon as calmly as usual, and then when the
tray had been taken away she opened the window wide
and poured a packet of cedarwood dust on the fire&mdash;and
she was sitting demurely at the table when from
the library Lady Garribardine and Mr. Strobridge
came in.</p>

<p>Gerard Strobridge carried a bag full of papers and
looked cross and harassed.</p>

<p>"Now G. you may have the services of Miss Bush
until five o'clock; that will give you two hours and a
half&mdash;you must not keep her, as she is going home to-night&mdash;then
come up to my sitting-room to tea," and
Lady Garribardine went out of the other door which
her nephew held open for her.</p>

<p>Katherine had risen and gone immediately to a cupboard,
ostensibly to get something out for her work,
so she hoped Her Ladyship had not remarked her hair&mdash;which
indeed had happily been the case.</p>

<p>Mr. Strobridge had not even glanced in her direction,
but her moment came when she sat down at the
typing machine, and looked straight up into his eyes
as she asked in her deep alluring voice:</p>

<p>"What do you wish me to begin upon, please?"</p>

<p>Then he took in the whole effect and a wave of intense
astonishment swept over him. What had happened?
Was he dreaming? Was this beautiful creature
the ordinary, silent, admirable typist, Katherine
Bush?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>


<p>He pulled himself together and took some papers
from his bag without speaking, and when he
had selected two or three, he drew a chair up
to the other side of the table and began to dictate,
stopping every now and then to explain the purport of
his arguments.</p>

<p>They worked so for perhaps an hour.</p>

<p>"One has to do these things," he said at last, as
Katherine had not uttered a word. "One wonders sometimes
if there is any good in them."</p>

<p>"I suppose all effort has some merit," she responded,
without looking up. He began to long to make her
raise her eyes again.</p>

<p>"You think so?&mdash;On what grounds?"</p>

<p>"It exercises a useful faculty."</p>

<p>"What faculty?"</p>

<p>"Will, of course; to use effort is an exercise of will,
because if there was no effort needed, no will would be
required either."</p>

<p>He smiled whimsically; this was obvious.</p>

<p>"Then I must look upon the organisation of this very
intricate charity, of doubtful use to mankind, as profitable
to me because of the effort entailed."</p>

<p>"It is as good a way as any other of looking at it.&mdash;Did
you say quarterly or monthly returns upon the
capital?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;er&mdash;" glancing at his papers&mdash;"the confounded
thing! Where is it&mdash;Yes&mdash;quarterly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>The machine clicked uninterruptedly. Katherine
never looked up.</p>

<p>He began to allow himself to take in details. Why
had he not remarked before that she had an extraordinarily
well-shaped head?&mdash;And what wonderful hands&mdash;in
these days of athletic, weather-beaten paws! She
would be very stately, too, when she filled out a little.
The whole thing was agreeably symmetrical, throat and
shoulders, and bust and hips.</p>

<p>"Why, in the name of all the gods, have I never
noticed this young woman before! She thinks, too!
That was a curious reflection about will&mdash;I'd like to
talk to her&mdash;The devil takes this d&mdash;d&mdash;charity!"</p>

<p>So his thoughts ran and his eyes eagerly devoured
Katherine's face.</p>

<p>She was perfectly conscious of the fact; she knew
with unerring instinct that the spark which she had
dispatched by that first steady gaze of her eyes had
struck tinder, the flame of interest was ignited, and
the more difficult she made things now, the more complete
would be her triumph presently. She resolutely
kept her attention upon her work, never raising her
head.</p>

<p>"To be so meritoriously industrious, are you using
effort?" he asked, in a moment or two. "You look as
though you had a most formidable will!"</p>

<p>"Very little effort; it is second nature to me now."</p>

<p>"Even if the subject is as uninteresting as this?"</p>

<p>"That is all the better; one can let one's mechanical
brain tackle it, and one's real thoughts can wander."</p>

<p>"Where to?"</p>

<p>She put in a fresh sheet of paper&mdash;and now glanced
at him again for one second.</p>

<p>"Into dreamland."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, that is a ridiculously pleasant place devoid of
draughts and of chilling surprises. It would be very
impertinent, I suppose, if I asked you where is your
dreamland?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not impertinent&mdash;out of place. You are
dictating a letter to the Lord Mayor of London at
the moment."</p>

<p>"To be sure I am&mdash;you made me forget it&mdash;he is an
infernal bore, the Lord Mayor of London, compelling
me to branch off from this very interesting conversation
to his confounded letter!&mdash;I beg your pardon!"</p>

<p>Katherine read aloud the last coherent sentence he
had given her, and she permitted one of her faint
sphinxlike smiles to play about her mouth, while her
eyes sought the typing.</p>

<p>Gerard Strobridge moved a little nearer&mdash;he felt a
sudden strong thrill.</p>

<p>"I shall not give you another word to type until you
tell me about your dreamland&mdash;Is it in sea or sky or
air?"</p>

<p>"It is half-past three o'clock and you are only to
stay until five&mdash;had you not better attend to your work
first, sir?"</p>

<p>She was waiting in an attitude of respectful attention,
infinitely provoking.</p>

<p>"Certainly not! I shall ask my aunt to lend you to
me for another day if we do not finish this afternoon&mdash;Indeed,
on second thoughts, I do not think I shall try
to finish to-day&mdash;we can complete the matter at Blissington&mdash;"
And then he stopped abruptly&mdash;L&auml;o Delemar
would be there! He had melted her into a mood
from which everything could be hoped during this week
of uneventful family party&mdash;Beatrice would only stay
for Christmas Day, and was indeed no great obstacle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
in any case. But he feared he would probably not be
able to have interesting business interviews during the
holidays with his aunt's typist.</p>

<p>He laughed shortly to himself, and dictated a long
sentence, concluding the letter to the Lord Mayor. He
had better control the interest he was feeling, that was
evident!</p>

<p>Katherine made no remark, while she wondered what
had stopped his questioning so suddenly. She smiled
again a little. It had the desired effect&mdash;Mr. Strobridge
jumped up from his chair and went to the fireplace.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what are you thinking about?" he demanded,
from there.</p>

<p>"My work, of course! What else should I be thinking
about?" Her eyes at last met his in innocent surprise.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you are quite truthful&mdash;one does not
smile in that enigmatic fashion over work&mdash;dull, tedious
work like this, statistics of bodies who are to benefit
by this absurd charity&mdash;Oh! no, fair scribe! I feel
there lies a world of malice in that smile."</p>

<p>"Even a scribe is permitted sometimes to make reflections."</p>

<p>"Not without confessing what they are."</p>

<p>"We are not in the days of the Spanish Inquisition&mdash;"
taking up a paper. "On the first list there is
a letter for the Mayor of Manchester."</p>

<p>"Confound the Mayor of Manchester!"</p>

<p>"Poor gentleman!"</p>

<p>"I must know all about dreamland and cryptic reflections
first."</p>

<p>He drew the armchair now over towards her and
flung himself into it. He was a graceful creature, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
so tall or so ideally perfect of form as Lord Algy, but
a very presentable Englishman, with a wonderful distinction
of manner and voice.</p>

<p>Katherine Bush was experiencing intense pleasure&mdash;there
was something feline, if not altogether feminine,
in her well-balanced brain. It was peculiarly gratifying
to find that her plans were being justified. How glad
she was that he had not remarked her in her raw days!
How wise she had been to have made ready&mdash;and then
waited! The whole thing was the more effective because
of the complete absence of all dramatic emotion
in her. She was like a quiet, capable foreign minister
playing his game of statecraft with the representative
of another country, his face permitted to express&mdash;or
conceal&mdash;only what he desired.</p>

<p>At this moment, she shrugged her shoulders very
slightly, as though to say, "I am only an employer. I
cannot force you to work if you will not"; but she did
not speak, so he was obliged to demand again.</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me what made you smile?&mdash;We can
drift to dreamland afterwards."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I will not tell you what made me smile, because
I do not know exactly; the aspect of life generally,
perhaps."</p>

<p>"And you sit and work in this gloomy back room
all day&mdash;What do you know about life?"</p>

<p>"I am observing&mdash;I know that one must pretend interest
in what one is bored by&mdash;and one must show
attention to those one despises&mdash;and&mdash;keep from laughing
at things."</p>

<p>"What a dangerous young woman, watching and
coming to cynical conclusions&mdash;but you say truly; one
must keep from laughing at things&mdash;a very difficult
matter generally." He lay back against the brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
leather cushion, and proved the truth of this by laughing
softly, while he looked at her quaintly.</p>

<p>Katherine Bush suddenly felt that a human being
understood <i>with her</i>; it was a delightful sensation.</p>

<p>"Practically the whole of life is a ridiculous sham
and must arouse the sardonic mirth of the gods&mdash;Here
are you and I spending an afternoon arranging
a charity in which neither of us takes the least interest&mdash;I
am dictating fulsome letters to Lord Mayors to induce
them to influence others to open their purses&mdash;I
don't care a jot whether they do or they do not&mdash;You
are mechanically transcribing my asinine words, and we
could be so much better employed exchanging views&mdash;on
each other's taste, say&mdash;or each other's dreamlands."</p>

<p>Katherine Bush looked down and allowed her hands
to fall idly in her lap&mdash;he should do most of the speaking.</p>

<p>"The only good that I have been getting out of it as
far as I can see," he went on, "is the contemplation of
your really beautiful hands at work&mdash;Where did you
get such perfect things in these days?"</p>

<p>She lifted one and regarded it critically.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have often wondered myself. My father was
an auctioneer, you know, and my mother's father was
a butcher."</p>

<p>Gerard Strobridge was extremely entertained. She
was certainly a very wonderful product of such parentage.</p>

<p>"May I look at them closely?" he asked.</p>

<p>She showed not the least embarrassment; if he had
been asking to see a piece of enamel, or a china vase
she could not have been more detached about it. She
held them out quite naturally, and he rose and took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
them in his own. Their touch was cool and firm, and
every inch of his being tingled with pleasure. He examined
them minutely finger by finger, stroking the rosy
filbert nails in admiration, while an insane desire to
clasp and kiss their owner grew in him.</p>

<p>Katherine Bush was perfectly aware of this, and
when she thought he had felt emotion enough for the
occasion, she drew them back as naturally as she had
given them.</p>

<p>"I am always asking myself questions about such
things," she remarked, in a tone of speculative matter-of-factness.
"I am so often seeing contradictions since
I have been here&mdash;My former conclusions are a little
upset."</p>

<p>"What were they?" He had returned to his chair.
He was no novice to be carried away by his sensations,
and he knew very well that to indulge them further at
present would be very unwise, and perhaps check a
most promising amusement.</p>

<p>"I believed that birth and breeding gave fine ears
and fine ankles and fine hands&mdash;as well as moral qualities."</p>

<p>"And you have been disappointed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very&mdash;have not you?"</p>

<p>"No, because I have had no illusions&mdash;one never can
tell where a side cross comes in, or what will be the
effect of overbreeding&mdash;that runs to enormities sometimes."</p>

<p>"I suppose so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And have the moral qualities surprised you
also?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;more than the physical; I have seen and
heard what I would have thought were common things
even at Bindon's Green."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>He laughed again&mdash;If the crew who had attended the
tableaux rehearsals could have heard her!</p>

<p>"You are perfectly right&mdash;looked at in the abstract,
I suppose we are rather a shoddy company nowadays."</p>

<p>"There are individuals who come up to the measure,
of course, but not all of them, as I had imagined. You
must have opened the doors to quite ordinary people
to have made such a mixture."</p>

<p>"We have grown indifferent; we no longer care about
a standard, I fear."</p>

<p>"That is why you let all these Radicals be in power,
perhaps&mdash;You have become effete like the nobles before
the revolution in France, who could only die like gentlemen,
but not live like men."</p>

<p>Gerard Strobridge was startled. This from the
granddaughter of a butcher of Bindon's Green!</p>

<p>"She picks it all up from Seraphim, of course," he
reflected presently. "And yet&mdash;look at her strange
face!&mdash;it is a woman of parts from wherever it has
come!"</p>

<p>"That is an apt phrase&mdash;where did you find it&mdash;'die
like gentleman, but not live like men'?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, it just came from thinking and reading
about them&mdash;so much was fine, and so much&mdash;foolish."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and you think we are growing also to that
stage in England? Perhaps you are right; we want
some great national danger to pull us together."</p>

<p>"You will rust out otherwise, and it will be such a
pity."</p>

<p>"You think we are good enough to keep?"</p>

<p>"In your highest development&mdash;like Her Ladyship&mdash;you
are, I should think, the best things for a country
in the world."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>She knew he was drawing her out and was very
pleased to be so drawn.</p>

<p>"Tell me about us&mdash;what have we that is good?"</p>

<p>"You have a sense of values&mdash;you know what is worth
having&mdash;You have had hundreds of years to acquire
the quality of looking ahead. No person of the classes
from which the Radical statesmen are drawn has naturally
the quality of looking ahead; he has to be told
about it, and then get it if he can&mdash;it is not in his blood
because his forebears only had to snatch what they
could for themselves and their families day by day, and
were not required to observe any broad horizon."</p>

<p>"How very true&mdash;you are a student of heredity then,
Miss Bush?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;it explains everything. I examine it in myself;
I am always combating ordinary and cramping
instincts which I find I have got."</p>

<p>"How interesting!"</p>

<p>"No common Radical could be a successful foreign
minister, for instance&mdash;unless perhaps he were a Jew
like Disraeli&mdash;but they have sense enough to know that
themselves, and always choose a gentleman, don't
they?"</p>

<p>"You wonderful girl&mdash;do you ever air these views
to my aunt? They would please her."</p>

<p>"Of course not&mdash;Her Ladyship is my employer and
she knows my place. I speak to her when I am spoken
to."</p>

<p>"You think we on our side are too casual, then?&mdash;That
we are letting our birthright slip from us&mdash;I believe
you are right."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;you are too sure of yourselves. You think
it does not matter really&mdash;and so you let the others
creep in with lies and promises&mdash;you let them alter all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
the standards of public honour without a protest, and
so you will gradually sink to the new level, too&mdash;I feel
very sorry for England sometimes."</p>

<p>"So do I&mdash;" his face altered. He looked sad, and
in earnest and older. For the moment he forgot that
he was wasting valuable time in the most agreeable task
of exploiting the ideas of a new species of female; her
words had touched a matter very near his weary heart.</p>

<p>"What can we do?" he cried, in a tone of deep interest.
"That is the question&mdash;what can we do?"</p>

<p>"You should all wake up to begin with, like people
do when they find that their houses have caught fire&mdash;at
least, those whom the smoke has not suffocated first.
You ought to make a concentrated, determined effort to
save what you can to build a new shelter with."</p>

<p>"Admitted&mdash;but how?"</p>

<p>"Have common sense taught from the beginning in
the schools, the reasons of things explained to the children.
If you knew the frightful ignorance upon all
the subjects that matter which prevails among my class,
for instance! They have false perspectives about everything&mdash;not
because they are bad; in the mass they
are much better than you&mdash;but because they are so
frightfully ignorant of the meaning of even the little
they have learnt. Everything has a false value for
them. There is hardly a subject that they can see
straightly about; they are muffled and blighted with
shams and hypocrisies."</p>

<p>"You should address meetings among them."</p>

<p>"They would not listen to me for a moment; the
truths I would tell them would wound their vanity; it
would only be in the schools among the children that
anything effectual could be done."</p>

<p>"You think so?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know&mdash;My own sisters and brothers are
examples. I could never teach them anything, and there
are millions in England just like them. Good as gold&mdash;and
stupid as owls."</p>

<p>"It does not sound hopeful, then."</p>

<p>"No, the rust has gone too far; there should have
been no education at all, or a better one&mdash;but the present
system looks as if it would swamp England if the
children are not taught things soon."</p>

<p>"You are a Tory, it would seem."</p>

<p>"No, I don't think I am. I think everyone has an
equal right, but only according to his capacity; and I
certainly don't think the scum of the earth of idiots
and wastrels have equal rights with hardworking, sensible
artisans."</p>

<p>"Indeed, no?&mdash;Go on!"</p>

<p>"I think aristocrats are things apart from the opportunities
they have had, and should know it, and
keep up the prestige and make their order a great goal
to strive for. You see, if they were stamped out, it
would be like cutting down all the old trees in Kensington
Gardens; they could not be produced again for
hundreds of years, and all the beauty and dignity of
the gardens would be gone. But aristocrats ought to
act as such, and never slip into the gutter."</p>

<p>"There you are certainly right. I am more than with
you&mdash;But what can one do?"</p>

<p>"You should have the courage of your opinions, as
Her Ladyship has&mdash;you only laugh when she is saying
splendid things sometimes. So few of you seem to have
any backbone that I have seen."</p>

<p>"You shame me!"</p>

<p>Her face became filled with a humorous expression&mdash;they
had been serious long enough, she thought. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
caught the light of her eyes; he was intensely fascinated.</p>

<p>"You did not, of course, come from&mdash;Bindon's Green&mdash;is
it?&mdash;You came down from Parnassus to teach us
poor devils of aristocrats to stick to our guns&mdash;I will
be your first disciple, priestess of wisdom!"</p>

<p>"It is five minutes to four, sir&mdash;it will be quite impossible
to finish that pile of papers to-day&mdash;And I <i>did</i>
come from Bindon's Green&mdash;and I am going back there
by the six o'clock train from Victoria, to a supper
party at my home&mdash;That is why my hair is crimped
and I have on this new blouse."</p>

<p>He got up and stood quite near her.</p>

<p>"And what will you do at the party? I can't see
you there."</p>

<p>"I shall look disagreeable, as I generally do. We
shall have supper of cold pressed beef and cold meat-pie,
and cheese-cakes and figs and custard, and some
light dinner ale or stout, and cups of tea&mdash;and then
when we have finished that, there are a whole lot of
new nigger song records for the gramophone, and my
brother Bert will recite imitations of Harry Lauder,
and my future sister-in-law, Miss Mabel Cawber, will
sing 'The Chocolate Soldier' out of tune&mdash;We shall
make a great deal of noise, and then we shall push the
furniture back and dance the turkey trot and the
bunny hug, and some of the elder ones, like my sister
Matilda, will make up a whist-drive, and at about one
o'clock I can get to bed."</p>

<p>"It sounds perfectly ideal; but you return from
this to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;by an early train. I am not a favourite at
home. Now will you please begin again to dictate."</p>

<p>He walked up and down the room for a minute; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
was not a boy accustomed only to acting from inclination;
he knew very well that it would be much wiser
now to resume attention to business. So he took up
his memoranda and started once more, and for over
half an hour nothing but dictation passed between
them; the pile of papers grew considerably less.</p>

<p>"If you care to give me directions for the rest quickly,
I will take them down in shorthand, and then I could
finish all this to-morrow, some time. Her Ladyship,
I am sure, would be better pleased if her whole scheme
is complete."</p>

<p>He agreed&mdash;he truly admired her perfect composure
and common sense; she was so capable and practical, a
person to be relied upon. He would do as she suggested,
though he had not heard about dreamland yet.</p>

<p>He set his mind to the affair on hand, and before
the clock struck five all was done and ready for this
admirable young woman to type when she had leisure.
And now he took her hand again.</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks, Egeria," he said. "You ought
to discover a likely lad and turn him into the Prime
Minister. You would make an ideal Prime Minister's
wife&mdash;but&mdash;er&mdash;don't look for him at Bindon's Green!"</p>

<p>"No, I won't&mdash;good-night, Mr. Strobridge. Thank
you for your wishes&mdash;but I have other views. I shall
not turn my 'lad' into anything; he shall turn me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Into what?"</p>

<p>"That is still in the lap of the gods," and she made
him the slightest curtsey, and went with a bundle of
receipts to the cupboard in the wall, while her grey-green
eyes laughed at him over her shoulder.</p>

<p>As Gerard Strobridge walked up the shallow marble
steps to his aunt's sitting-room, he felt like a man in
a dream.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>


<p>"What are you thinking of, G.?" Lady Garribardine
said, noticing after a little while
his preoccupation. "That wretched charity
has tired you out, dear boy&mdash;I hope Miss Bush was
efficient?"</p>

<p>"Quite&mdash;" and he lay back in his very comfortable
chair and devoured a bit of brown bread and butter.
"The whole thing is practically finished. Your secretary
very kindly said she would complete alone the last
directions, which she took down in shorthand."</p>

<p>"Then it will be done, G.; she is a young person of
her word."</p>

<p>Mr. Strobridge did not become expansive; it was
fortunate, he thought, that he had never yet shown
any interest in Katherine Bush, because very little escaped
his aunt's perceptions.</p>

<p>She was already wondering what caused his absence
of mind. He surely was not being so foolish as to
have allowed himself to become seriously enamoured of
L&auml;o Delemar! Her precious Gerard! This must be
ascertained at once.</p>

<p>"L&auml;o telephoned just now that she would not come to
the play to-night&mdash;Really, the caprices of these pretty
women are quite intolerable, throwing one over at a
moment's notice&mdash;masses of selfishness and conceit."</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;aren't they?" languidly.</p>

<p>This did not sound a lover's disappointment, but perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
he was prepared for her news, and L&auml;o's proposed
absence was what caused his depression.</p>

<p>"What excuse has she given you?"</p>

<p>He looked surprised.</p>

<p>"None. I did not know that she had chucked; did
she give any reason?"</p>

<p>"Some nonsense about a friend of her mother's having
turned up. I was so annoyed that I put the receiver
down."</p>

<p>"You must console me, <i>carina</i>," and he leaned forward
and took his aunt's fat hand. "L&auml;o would never
be missed if a man might count upon you for his partner."</p>

<p>"Flatterer!" but she smiled complacently. "The
Colvins can both talk to Tom Hawthorne then. I had
intended Henry Colvin to be my portion; he is a bright
creature, and distracted me at dinner last week&mdash;but
I am tired, and I always prefer you, G. Ah! if you
had only been my son!"</p>

<p>"It would have destroyed the happiest of relationships
in the world&mdash;and you know it. A son you could
overscold&mdash;a mother I could overrespect&mdash;Let us
thank Heaven for the charming courtesy tie that we
enjoy."</p>

<p>"I wish you would have a son, though, G.; you know
I am perfectly indifferent to Emmeline's boy."</p>

<p>"I shall never have any Strobridge children, Seraphim.
Beatrice would faint at the idea. We only
touched upon domestic pretences and got them all over
with the very lightest effort in the first week. Besides,
one would not want a Thorvil child&mdash;there is a mad
streak in the whole family, I have often thought. I
am much interested in heredity."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not add how greatly the afternoon had augmented
this interest!</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;did you chance to notice my secretary's
hands?&mdash;The mother must have had a lover, of course."</p>

<p>"I don't think so&mdash;they seldom do in that class.
They become so intolerably unattractive at once; nothing
human could come up to the scratch. It is just a
freak, or a harking back&mdash;many of the exquisitely aristocratic
features one finds in old villagers, for instance,
date from the <i>droit de seigneur</i>."</p>

<p>"The whole question of heredity is a frightfully serious
one, of course, and we are in a stupendous muddle
at the present time, with the inroads of the Lord knows
who to muddy the stream."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose that is the cause of the dry rot
which has got into us?&mdash;Or is it that we are really rusting
out?"</p>

<p>"It is luxury and humanitarianism, and absence of
national foes, which have sent us to sleep&mdash;and forgetfulness
of dignity and duty. We eat the food of those
whose fathers fed in our fathers' kitchens, and not because
they are worthy and nice&mdash;that would be quite
justifiable if so&mdash;but just because they are rich and
have a superb chef, or because they are giving our
younger sons a lift in the city&mdash;I loathe all money-making
and trade&mdash;I am thankful that I, at least, can
stand on my own feet, though I see the sad decadence
in all around me&mdash;But I must not talk like this;
it depresses and ages me!&mdash;By the way, Sterling had
the impertinence to tell me that she thought my new
toup&eacute;es from Paris are too light!&mdash;What do you
say, G.?"</p>

<p>He looked at her critically, at the clever, shrewd,
painted old face and the ridiculous girlish wig&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
then he kissed her hand again, and told her the truth.
Something about her words touched him infinitely.</p>

<p>"I adore very dark hair when it is going grey,
Seraphim. I have often thought how beautiful you
would be if you burnt all those things. Your sense of
humour is so supreme, they always seem incongruous."</p>

<p>"I will, then, this very New Year, while we are at
Blissington. It will be the sensation when we return to
town. Sarah Lady Garribardine with snow-white hair!"</p>

<p>"No, iron grey. It will make your eyes brighter."</p>

<p>"It shall be done!" Then she laughed softly. "G.,
how goes it with L&auml;o&mdash;you are not in love?"</p>

<p>Mr. Strobridge shook his head regretfully.</p>

<p>"Alas! not an atom. I fear it won't last until the
Easter recess."</p>

<p>"She is artificial."</p>

<p>"Extremely."</p>

<p>"And hopelessly vague."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but quite charming."</p>

<p>"Beatrice says she pretends to be full of sex and
other dreadful natural things&mdash;you always had fruity
tastes, Beatrice avers!"</p>

<p>"My tastes <i>are</i> fruity, but are never gratified in these
modern days, alas! She is quite wrong about L&auml;o,
though; she is as cold as ice. She smiles with equal
sweetness upon the waiters when we are lunching at
restaurants. She is merely a lovely woman demanding
incense from all things male.</p>

<p>"Beatrice said 'pretends,' remember&mdash;Beatrice is not
at all dense!"</p>

<p>"No, quite a subtle companion when not composing
odes, or discussing the intensity of blue with Hebe
Vermont."</p>

<p>"&mdash;Are you glad L&auml;o is coming for Christmas?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"Y&mdash;es. I shall want some of your very best champagne."</p>

<p>"You shall have it, G., and I will try to make things
difficult for you as a sort of appetiser. I have some
kind of feeling that you are depressed, dear boy?&mdash;I
am putting L&auml;o in the parrot suite."</p>

<p>"It will suit her admirably."</p>

<p>Then they both laughed.</p>

<p>"But you are depressed, G.?"</p>

<p>"A shadow of coming events, perhaps! not exactly
disaster, or I should be what the Scotch call 'fey,'"
and he sighed. He felt very fatigued and disturbed, and
he hardly knew what.</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine did not press the matter. She
had enormous tact.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Delemar at that moment was lying upon her
sofa in a ravishing saffron gauze teagown smoking
scented cigarettes, while she discussed her heart's
secrets with a dearest friend.</p>

<p>"Gerard is madly in love with me, Agnes. I hardly
know what to do about it. I have chucked for to-night
on purpose to give him a setback."</p>

<p>"It will be most cosy dining here alone with Bobbie
Moreland and Jimmy and me. You were quite right,
darling."</p>

<p>"Poor Bobbie, back from that horrible India where
he has been for a year&mdash;of course, I could not refuse
him&mdash;But Lady Garribardine is wild."</p>

<p>"It would not do to offend her really, L&auml;o sweet.
You must be penitent and send her some flowers to-morrow."</p>

<p>If Katherine Bush had been there, she would have
seen a strong likeness in Mrs. Delemar to her future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
sister-in-law, Mabel Cawber; her cigarette ash was
knocked off in almost as dainty a fashion as that lady
employed in using her spoon. Mrs. Delemar <i>never</i>
ceased remembering that she was a beautiful woman,
and must act accordingly; the only difference between
them was that Mabel Cawber <i>never</i> forgot that she was
a perfect lady, and was determined that no one should
miss this fact if she could help it. Their souls were
on a par&mdash;or whatever animating principle did duty as
a soul in each.</p>

<p>Mrs. Delemar returned to the subject of Gerard with
a sigh, telling her friend Agnes the most intimate things
he had said to her and giving her pleasing descriptions
of her own emotions, too. Gerard was a feather for
any woman's cap, and Agnes should know how crazily
in love he was with her.</p>

<p>"I think he'll do something desperate, darling&mdash;if I
don't give way soon&mdash;I wish men were like us, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"One must please the creatures, or they would not
stay."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but oh! isn't it a shocking bore&mdash;that part&mdash;if
they only knew!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Katherine Bush, meanwhile, was arriving at Laburnum
Villa, where a crowd of sisters and friends welcomed
her home.</p>

<p>Fresh from the entrancing fencing match with
Gerard Strobridge, their well-meant chaff and badinage
sounded extremely bald. But among them poor Gladys
was silent, and sat with flushed cheeks and overbright
eyes, looking at Katherine.</p>

<p>"I want to talk to you, Glad," this latter said, kindly.
"Lady Garribardine has given me ten pounds to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
a real evening frock with. I must have it to take down
to Blissington for Christmas&mdash;we go to-morrow week.
But can I get it in the time?"</p>

<p>Gladys was all interest at once. Clothes were a real
passion for her. She devised something pretty; but
five pounds would be quite enough. Katherine had better
have two dresses, a black and that lovely new shade
of mauve.</p>

<p>"I'll have the black, the very simplest that there can
be, if you know of one of your hands who could make
it for me. I'll leave it entirely to you."</p>

<p>Gladys was delighted, and then her large prominent
eyes grew haunted and wistful.</p>

<p>"I'd like awfully to talk to you to-night, Kitten,"
she said. "May I come to your room?"</p>

<p>Permission was given, and they all went to supper.
It was exactly as Katherine had described it that afternoon,
and Mr. Prodgers was there in his best frock
coat, more full of what Miss Ethel Bush called "swank"
mixed with discomfort than Katherine had ever known
him. If she had not felt so deeply that these people
were her own flesh and blood, she could have been
amused by the whole thing.</p>

<p>Nothing could equal the condescension of Miss Cawber.
Lady Garribardine's name was not entirely unknown
to her&mdash;although, to be sure, it was not in the
same class as that of the Duchess of Dashington, Lady
Hebe Vermont or any of the "smart set"&mdash;but still it
had chanced once now and then to have appeared in
the society column of the <i>Flare</i>, she rather thought as
the patroness of some dull old political thing&mdash;and yes&mdash;more
recently in connection with those <i>tableaux
vivants</i>, which Miss Cawber was dying to hear the details
of; perhaps Katherine could gratify his need?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did Hebe Vermont look a dream as Sicchy and Lord
St. Aldens as Cupid? My! they must have been a pair!
I always do say to Fred when we meet them at church
parade of a Sunday that they are the real thing."</p>

<p>Katherine for once took up the gauntlet, while one
of her sphinxlike smiles hovered about her mouth.</p>

<p>"<i>Lady</i> Hebe Vermont played Psyche&mdash;if that is who
you mean by 'Sicchy'&mdash;but who is Lord St. Aldens,
Mabel? Mr. John St. Aldens, who acted Cupid, is an
'Honourable'; he is a Baron's son, his father is Lord
Hexam."</p>

<p>Mabel reddened; while maintaining for the most part
a rather chilling silence with her, Katherine had never
before deliberately crossed swords. She felt indignant!
A paid companion to try to make her look foolish before
the others! She who had never done a stroke of
work even in a business house in her life! She would
have to put this future sister-in-law in her place, and
no mistake! Her manner plainly showed that Katherine
was in disgrace, as she answered loftily:</p>

<p>"Really, I ought to know&mdash;My father was a great
friend of his father, and often went to their place."</p>

<p>"In what capacity, Mabel?" Katherine smiled. "We
none of us remember your father, but Liv and Dev
told me once when I asked them that he had been an
under-clerk at Canford and Crin's&mdash;the St. Alden
solicitors&mdash;and then passed the examinations. From
what I've learned about his sort of people by living
among them for a month, I don't expect Lord Hexam
was very intimate with Mr. Cawber&mdash;but we are all
acquainted in the same way, aren't we, Tild? You remember
hearing of this family from mother's father,
who was their butcher for the river house at Maidenhead."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>Mabel glared; this was sheer impertinence; her queenship
of this circle was not being treated with proper
respect&mdash;How vulgar of Katherine, she thought!</p>

<p>Mabel's refinement was almost of the degree of the
Boston lady who insisted upon the piano's "limbs" being
put into pantaloons with frills. She would hardly have
spoken of a butcher! She felt particularly annoyed
now also, because the clerk episode was a fact which
she thought was quite unknown&mdash;the solicitorship at
Bindon's Green having gloriously advanced the family
fortunes.</p>

<p>Poor Matilda was quite upset and reproached Katherine
when she succeeded in getting her into a corner
alone.</p>

<p>"Whatever did you speak to Mabel like that for,
Kitten?&mdash;And I am sure we need not tell everyone
about Grandpa&mdash;since he did not live here."</p>

<p>"Her nonsense makes me feel quite sick, Tild&mdash;she is
always pretending some ridiculous knowledge and acquaintanceship
with the aristocracy. She gets all the
names wrong, and gives herself away all the time; it
does her good to be found out once in a way."</p>

<p>Matilda could bear this side of the affair, but resented
the allusion to the butcher with undiminished
fervour.</p>

<p>"Oh! what awful snobs you all are!" Katherine exclaimed,
exasperated out of her amused tolerance at
last. "I am not the least ashamed of him: I am proud,
on the contrary. He was honest and made money. Why
are you and Mabel and all your friends such absurd
shams, Tild!&mdash;There is nothing disgraceful in being
lower middle class; it is honourable and worthy. Why
on earth pretend to belong to another, when anyone
who knows can see it is untrue&mdash;or if you hate your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
real station, then do as I am doing, educate yourself
out of it."</p>

<p>"Educate myself out of it!" Matilda was incensed.
"Why, I'm sure we are all as fairly educated as any
ladies need be."</p>

<p>This point of view naturally ended the argument
for Katherine; she could only smile again.</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;it is your birthday, dear old Tild, so I
won't quarrel with you! By the way, where is Bob
Hartley? I don't see him here to-night."</p>

<p>The fianc&eacute; of Gladys was prevented from coming by
a severe cold, she was informed.</p>

<p>And so the evening passed with the Bunny Hug and
games, and the gramophone shouted forth its nigger
songs, in which they all joined.</p>

<p>"Hasn't it been too lovely, Kitten," Matilda said
affectionately&mdash;her whilom indignation fled as they
walked up the narrow stairs. "I've never had such a
perfect birthday party, and I am sure you could not
have had a more refined, enjoyable evening, not in any
home."</p>

<p>Katherine kissed her as she turned into her room.</p>

<p>"You dear old Tild," she said, and then presently
Gladys came in.</p>

<p>Katherine was seated in a shrunk dressing-gown
which she had left behind, and Em'ly had lighted a fire
in the attic grate.</p>

<p>The two girls looked at one another, and then Gladys
was asked to sit down.</p>

<p>"I know what you are going to say," and Katherine's
voice was deep and level. "You would not have to say
it if you had not always been such a fool, my poor Glad&mdash;you
have got into trouble, of course, and Bob Hartley
is not playing the game."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>Gladys burst into passionate sobs.</p>

<p>"However did you guess, Kitten! Why, Tild doesn't
know a thing!"</p>

<p>"Most likely not&mdash;Well, what do you want him to
do&mdash;marry you?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course, Katherine; that is what he promised
most solemnly beforehand&mdash;at Brighton. You
know it is his mother who has kept him back; his Aunt
Eliza, with whom we stayed, is quite willing for me. I
am sure I'm as good as him, anyway."</p>

<p>Further sobs.</p>

<p>"Oh! that part does not matter a bit, as good or not
as good&mdash;these awful men like Bob Hartley always seduce
women with promises, solemn promises, of matrimony
and that sort of stuff; if they meant them, they
would not forestall matters&mdash;vile brutes!"</p>

<p>"There is no good in abusing Bob, Kitten; he has always
meant kind; it is his mother, I tell you, has got at
him!"</p>

<p>"Does she know?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my! I hope not. No one knows but you&mdash;and
Bob."</p>

<p>"Have you told him he must marry you at once?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I've implored him to on my bended knees."</p>

<p>"And he has refused?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;he can't break his mother's heart, he says, and
speaks of going to Australia."</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;go to bed now, dear&mdash;I will see him to-morrow
and see what I can do. I think he will marry
you next week, perhaps, after all. You must undertake
the inventing of a reason for the suddenness to the
family, if I accomplish the fact. Go now, dear&mdash;I want
to think."</p>

<p>Gladys sobbed her gratitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you don't believe I am really bad, Kitten, do
you? Indeed, I never wanted&mdash;anything&mdash;but Bob&mdash;We
went to the theatre one night and had a bit of supper&mdash;and
afterwards, I was so afraid he would be off to
Carry Green if I did not do as he wished."</p>

<p>Two great tears grew in Katherine's beautiful eyes,
and rolled slowly down her white cheeks.</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;most men are devils, Glad&mdash;but nine-tenths
of the women are fools&mdash;and fools always have to pay
the price of everything in life. A woman always loses
a man if she gives way to him against her conscience.
You felt you were sinning all the time, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course, Kitten&mdash;I'm really a good girl."</p>

<p>"Then what else could you expect? If you feel you
are doing wrong, you must know you will be punished&mdash;that
attitude of yours was bound to have drawn&mdash;this.
I tell you, Glad, no one of your sort can afford to step
one foot aside out of the narrow path. You've 'sinned,'
as you call it&mdash;for love. It gave you no pleasure and
you have practically lost Bob&mdash;remember this, and
never give way to him in anything again."</p>

<p>"Why did you have the tears in your eyes, Katherine&mdash;?
You so cold!"</p>

<p>"It was stupid of me, but the incredible pitifulness
of some parts of life touched me for a moment. Now
go to bed, dear&mdash;and keep your courage up&mdash;don't let
Tild know; it would break her heart&mdash;and think of
Mabel!"</p>

<p>"Oh! My!" wailed Gladys, and went towards the
door.</p>

<p>Katherine jumped up suddenly, and gave her the ten-pound
note which had been lying under a box of matches
on the imitation oak dressing-chest.</p>

<p>"Here, Gladys, get the little black frock for me just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
as cheaply as ever you can. Lady Garribardine will
never know what it cost; she is accustomed to pay forty
or fifty pounds for her evening dresses&mdash;and you keep
all the rest. If&mdash;if&mdash;Bob should not be reasonable to-morrow,
it might be useful for you to have some money
that you need not account to Tild for&mdash;I know she looks
after everything that you have got."</p>

<p>"But you will make him, Katherine, oh! you will if
you can&mdash;you are so clever&mdash;and he'll be in the train
if you go by the early one. You'll have him alone."</p>

<p>"Very well. Bring me up a slice of bread or anything
you can find when you first go down; I can't stand the
family breakfast, and I will just rush off by the eight-five."</p>

<p>What she said to Mr. Bob Hartley she never told
anyone&mdash;but it was extraordinarily effectual&mdash;it contained
biting scorn and heavy threats. Among them,
his chief should know of his conduct that very day,
before he could possibly sneak off to Australia, unless he
went and got a special license. The Registry Office
would do very well, but by the following Wednesday
Gladys must be his wife, or Katherine's scorpion whip
would fall. He should be thrashed by Fred and Bert
and Charlie Prodgers, too! She would have no mercy
upon him&mdash;none at all.</p>

<p>"You poor, mean, sanctimonious, miserable cur,"
were some of her parting words to him. "Come into this
telegraph office with me and send this wire to Gladys
this minute. 'Will you honour me by marrying me on
Tuesday? If so, get ready.' You can pretend you
had a secret wedding to save expense, and tell them at
home on Christmas day."</p>

<p>Mr. Hartley was a thorough coward; his plans were
not matured enough yet to go to Australia, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
present berth was a good one, so he felt it was wiser
to give in and do what he was bid. And presently Katherine
got into a taxi and was whirled back to Berkeley
Square, where later in the day her sister's telegram of
rapturous thanks came to her.</p>

<p>But when she was alone that night by her comfortable
fire, she let a volume of Flaubert drop on her knees
and looked into the coals, her thoughts going back to
the painful incident. Here was a plain indication of
the working of laws shown in her own case and the difference
between it and that of Gladys. Alas! the piteous
fate of weaklings!</p>

<p>And then she set herself to analyse things. "Whether
the accepted idea of morality is right or is wrong&mdash;of
God or of man, those who break its laws are certainly
drawing to themselves the frightfully strong current of
millions of people's disapproval and so must run great
risk of punishment." Thus she mused and then her eyes
grew wide as she gazed into the glowing coals. <i>What</i>
if some day she should have to pay some price for her
own deviation from recognized standards?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>


<p>Christmas Day fell upon a Tuesday in 1911,
and on the Saturday before Katherine Bush accompanied
her employer, and the two dogs,
down to Blissington in the motor. She had only been
in one for short drives in the Bois with Lord Algy, so
to tear through the frozen country was a great joy to
her, although, not possessing proper wraps, she was
rather cold.</p>

<p>"You must have a fur coat, Miss Bush! I am greatly
annoyed that I did not remark that you were insufficiently
clad before we started. Here, crouch down under
this rug&mdash;and there is an extra one at my feet you
must wrap round you."</p>

<p>Katherine was grateful.</p>

<p>"Stirling must find you some warm garment of mine
while we are at Blissington. I have no patience with
idiots who deliberately take cold."</p>

<p>Katherine agreed with her.</p>

<p>"Do you know the English country, or are you quite
a cockney girl?" she was then asked.</p>

<p>"No, I hardly know it at all. I know Brighton, and
a lot of seaside places, but we never chanced to go to
the country for our holidays."</p>

<p>"It is a wonderful place, the English country, the
most beautiful in the world, I think; it will interest me
immensely to hear your impressions of it; after a week
you must tell me."</p>

<p>"I shall be very pleased to do so."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>"We pass Windsor; you must go over it some day&mdash;it
is only twenty miles from Blissington&mdash;. Are you interested
in historical associations?"</p>

<p>"Extremely&mdash;any places which are saturated with
the evolution of man and nations are interesting, I
think. I am afraid I would not care to go to Australia,
or a new country."</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine turned and looked at her secretary.
The creature evidently had a brain, and this
would be a good opportunity to draw her out.</p>

<p>"You feel the force of tradition, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;in everything. It acts for generations in
the blood&mdash;it makes people do all sorts of things, good
and bad, quite without reason."</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine chuckled&mdash;she loved discussions.</p>

<p>"How does it act in yourself, for instance?"</p>

<p>"I have tried to stop its action in myself, because I
saw the effects of the traditions of my class in my
brothers and sisters, and how stultifying it was."</p>

<p>"You certainly seem to have emerged from them in
an extraordinary manner&mdash;how did you set about it?"</p>

<p>Katherine thought a little and then answered deliberately.</p>

<p>"I always wanted to know the reason why of everything
and I soon felt sure that there was no such thing
as chance, but that everything which happened was part
of some scheme&mdash;and I always desired to be able to distinguish
between appearance and reality, and I got to
understand that personal emotion distorts all reality
and creates appearance, and so I began to try to dissociate
things from personal emotion in my judgments
of them."</p>

<p>"Yes, but how about tradition?"</p>

<p>"Tradition suggested certain views and actions to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
me&mdash;but looked at without emotion, I saw that they
were foolish. I analysed my brothers' and sisters' ideas
and instincts because I wanted to see if what I did not
like in them was inevitable in myself too from the force
of tradition or if there was any way to get rid of stupidities."</p>

<p>"And you found?"</p>

<p>"Of course, that everything, even instincts, can be
eradicated if only their origins can be traced and the
will is strong enough to overcome them."</p>

<p>"Yes, everything depends upon will. And you found
time for all this reasoning while you kept the accounts
at the pork-butcher's?"</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine's eyebrows ran quizzically up into
her forehead, and there was a twinkle in her eye. She
was greatly amused.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;in the evenings."</p>

<p>"No wonder you have emerged! You do not allow
yourself to have any emotions then?"</p>

<p>Katherine looked away demurely.</p>

<p>"I try not to indulge in them; it is more prudent to
watch their action in others."</p>

<p>"Have you ever been in love, child?"</p>

<p>"It depends upon what one calls love." The tone was
dignified. Katherine did not think this quite a fair
question.</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine laughed appreciatively.</p>

<p>"You are quite right. I should not have asked you
that, since we were up upon a plane of discussion in
which even women do not lie to one another!"</p>

<p>"If Your Ladyship will permit me to say so, women
have very little notion of truth, I think!"</p>

<p>"Oh! that is too bad. You must always stand up for
your sex."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Forgive me for differing, but I should be acting from
good nature in that case, not from justice."</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine was delighted.</p>

<p>"So you think we are not truthful as a company?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, we have no love of abstract truth, truth for
itself. When we are truthful in our general dealings
with people, it is either because we have decent characters
or religious views, or for our own ends, not from
a detached love of truth."</p>

<p>"What a cynic! And how about men?"</p>

<p>"A man is truthful because he likes truth, and to tell
lies he feels would degrade himself."</p>

<p>"And yet men always lie to women&mdash;have you remarked
that, girl?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that seems to be the one exception in their
standard of truth."</p>

<p>"How do you account for this? Have you found the
'reason why' of this peculiarity?"</p>

<p>"It seems presumptuous of me to give my views to
Your Ladyship."</p>

<p>"I think I am the best judge of that matter," and
Lady Garribardine frowned a little. "I asked a question."</p>

<p>Katherine answered then immediately. She was not
quite pleased with herself for her last remark, it had
laid her open to a snub.</p>

<p>"Original man had no regard for women&mdash;they were
as the animals to him&mdash;he would not have felt degraded
in lying to animals&mdash;because such a thing could not occur.
He would not consult animals&mdash;he simply ordered
them."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Then as soon as he had to consider women at all he
found it easier to lie to them because of their want of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
understanding, and chattering tongues, and as he did
not consider that they were his equals in anything, no
degradation was entailed in making things easy for himself
with them, by lying to them."</p>

<p>"How ingenuous!"</p>

<p>"That is how it seems to me, and so things have gone
on&mdash;tradition and instinct again! Until even now when
man is forced to consider women, the original instinct is
still there making him feel that it does not matter lying
to them."</p>

<p>"I believe you are right. You are not a suffragette?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I like women to advance in everything, but
unless you could destroy their dramatic instinct, and
hysteria, I think it would be a pity for a country if they
had votes."</p>

<p>"You despise women and respect men, then?"</p>

<p>"Not at all; it would be like despising bread and respecting
water. I only despise weakness in either sex."</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Bush, I think you have a wonderfully-stored
mind. I don't feel that ninety pounds a year and
drudgery is the right thing for you. What is to be
done?"</p>

<p>Katherine gave one of her rare soft laughs.</p>

<p>"Believe me, madam, the lessons I am learning in
Your Ladyship's service are worth more to me than my
salary. I am quite contented and enjoy my drudgery."</p>

<p>"So you are learning lessons&mdash;are you!" Lady Garribardine
chuckled again. "Of the world, the flesh or
the devil?"</p>

<p>"A little of all three, perhaps," Katherine answered
with shy demureness.</p>

<p>"Look here, young woman, I have remarked more
than once that you possess a quality&mdash;almost unknown
in ninety-nine females out of a hundred, and non-existent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
in the middle classes&mdash;a fine sense of humour. It is
quite out of place&mdash;and like the royal rose imprinted
upon the real queen's left shoulder, I expect we shall
discover presently that the butcher and baker forebears
are all moonshine, and that you are a princess in disguise.&mdash;See,
that is Windsor&mdash;isn't it fine?"</p>

<p>"Ah! Yes!" cried Katherine. "It makes one think."</p>

<p>They were rushing along the road from Staines where
they could see the splendid pile standing out against the
sky.</p>

<p>"All those old grey stones put together by brutes
and fools and brains and force. I will take you there
myself some day."</p>

<p>"I shall love to go."</p>

<p>Then Her Ladyship became quite silent as was her
custom when she felt inclined so to be. The obligation
to make conversation never weighed upon her. This
made her a delightful companion. They arrived at the
park gates of Blissington Court about one o'clock, and
Katherine Bush felt again a delightful excitement. She
had never seen a big English country home except in
pictures.</p>

<p>The lodge-keeper came out. He was an old man in
a quaint livery.</p>

<p>"I cannot stand the untidy females escaping from
the washtub who attend to most people's gates. This
family of Peterson have opened those of Blissington for
two hundred years, and have always worn the same sort
of livery, from father to son. Their intelligence is at
the lowest ebb, and they make capital gate-keepers.
There is generally a 'simple' boy or two to carry on the
business. The women folk keep out of sight, it is a tradition
in the family&mdash;they take a pride in it. I give
them unusually high wages, and whatever else grows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
more and more idiotic, the gate-keeping instinct survives
in full force. There are three lodges&mdash;all kept by
Petersons."</p>

<p>"How wonderful," said Katherine.</p>

<p>"Good day, Jacob!&mdash;The family well? Jane quite recovered
from the chicken-pox, eh?"</p>

<p>"Quite well, Your Ladyship," and the old man's wandering
eyes were fixed in adoration upon his mistress's
face. "And Your Ladyship's godchild, Sarah, is growing
that knowing my daughter can hardly keep her
from the front garden."</p>

<p>"I am delighted to hear it. I shall be stopping in to
see you to-morrow, tell Mrs. Peterson. This is my new
secretary, Miss Bush, Jacob&mdash;you will know her again,
won't you?"</p>

<p>"I'll try to, Your Ladyship," a little doubtfully, and
he bowed deeply as the motor rolled on along a beautiful
drive through the vast park, with its groups of
graceful deer peering at them from under the giant
trees.</p>

<p>Katherine was taking in the whole scene, the winter
day, and the brown earth, and the blue sky, and the
beauty of it all!</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;this sort of thing was what must be hers some
day when she had fitted herself to possess it. They came
to another gate&mdash;and yet another&mdash;iron ones with no
lodges, and then they swept through a wide avenue with
sprucely kept edges and so on up to the front door.</p>

<p>It was a long irregular building which Katherine saw,
principally built in the middle of the seventeenth century,
and added to from time to time. It was very picturesque,
and when they were inside, the hall proved to
be very fine. It was huge and square and panelled with
some good Grinling Gibbons carving, and quantities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
indifferently painted ancestors, for the most part in
stiff peers' robes.&mdash;They had been a distinguished crew,
not of the fox-hunting type.</p>

<p>"These are my people, Miss Bush, not Garribardines,"
Her Ladyship said, pointing to the portraits.
"They were not handsome, as you see, and evidently
did not encourage the best artists&mdash;the few who did are
in the other rooms and the picture gallery. Come, we
will go straight in to lunch; I am as hungry as a schoolboy&mdash;You
will lunch with me."</p>

<p>Bronson had gone down much earlier and was awaiting
them with two footmen, as dignified as usual.</p>

<p>The dining-room was in a panelled passage to the
right and was a long, low room of much earlier date.</p>

<p>"A relic incorporated later in the present structure,"
Katherine was told.</p>

<p>It was perfectly beautiful, she thought, with its deep
brown oak, wax polished to the highest lustre, and its
curtains of splendid Venetian velvet in faded crimson
and green, on a white satin ground all harmonious with
age and mellowing.</p>

<p>"I had a terrible struggle to oust the Victorian horrors
I had been brought up with, and which had insinuated
themselves, as all vulgar things do, into almost
every room among their betters&mdash;taste was quite dead
sixty years ago in my father's day. I had to combat
sentiment in myself and ruthlessly condemn the whole
lot."</p>

<p>"It is most beautiful." Katherine's admiration was
indeed sincere.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;it has been a great pleasure to me getting it
perfect. You shall see the whole house presently, but
now food is the only important matter.&mdash;Bronson&mdash;I
distrust the look of that ham souffl&eacute;&mdash;are you sure it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
has not been kept waiting? A second or two alters its
consistency. Take it away at once, man!"&mdash;with an
indignant sniff&mdash;"and tell Fran&ccedil;ois never to hazard so
precarious a dish again for arrivals by motor!"</p>

<p>"Very good, Your Ladyship."</p>

<p>"One can eat bread and cheese, but one cannot stomach
an indifferent souffl&eacute;&mdash;it is like an emotional woman,
its charm is just as capricious and just as ephemeral!"</p>

<p>The rest of the lunch was to her taste and no further
disapproval was expressed.</p>

<p>It was the first time Katherine had broken bread with
her mistress, or indeed had even assisted at a whole
luncheon. Coffee was the extent of her knowledge hitherto.
It interested her to see the varied dishes, to watch
the perfect service, the style of the placing and removing
of the plates&mdash;the rapidity and noiselessness of it
all. She thought of the pressed beef and the stout and
the cheese-cakes and the frightful untidiness of everything
at Laburnum Villa. That was the strange difference,
the utter want of method and order which always
rendered the home table a mass of litter and miscellaneous
implements towards the end of a repast,
plates and cups pushed here and there and everywhere.</p>

<p>How very good to be out of it all!</p>

<p>To her great surprise, Her Ladyship drank beer&mdash;clear
golden stuff poured from a lovely crystal and
silver jug into a chased silver tankard.</p>

<p>"The best beverage in Christendom!" that epicure
said, as she quaffed it. "Have some, Miss Bush. You
are young enough to have no dread of gout. It is a vice
with me, the worst thing in the world for my rheumatism,
and yet I cannot resist the temptation! The day
I return home I must fall to my tankard! To-morrow,
Bronson removes the accursed thing to the sideboard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
out of sight, and I keep up my courage on ridiculously
thin Zeltinger."</p>

<p>Katherine tasted it; it was delicious, and as different
from what she knew as beer as the tea had been from
her original idea of tea.</p>

<p>"Isn't it a heavenly drink, girl! I am glad to see you
like it."</p>

<p>Then Lady Garribardine chatted on, giving crisp,
witty descriptions of the village and the inhabitants,
in language which would often have shocked the genteel
sensibilities of Mabel Cawber, but the tones of her
voice, whether loud or soft, were the dulcet tones of
angels. She had indeed that "excellent thing in
woman."</p>

<p>Katherine's workroom was the old schoolroom up in a
wing which contained rooms as ancient as the dining-room,
and her bedroom adjoined it; and from this a
little passage led to a narrow staircase going down to
a door which opened into the small enclosed rose garden.
Up another set of steps from her corridor you
were brought into the splendid gallery which ran round
two sides of the hall, and into which Her Ladyship's
own rooms gave. But in Katherine's corner she was
isolated and could come and go abroad without ever
passing the general living rooms&mdash;what an advantage,
she felt!</p>

<p>And when, later in the afternoon, her things were unpacked,
and she was sitting before a glorious wood fire
in the old chimney, sniffing the scent of the burning
logs and taking in the whole picture of quaint chintz
and shining oak, she felt a sense of contentment and
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Fate was indeed treating her handsomely.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>


<p>Katherine saw nothing more of her employer
on the Saturday, but on the Sunday morning a
message came to say she would expect her to go
to church with her. As no mention of church had ever
been made in London, Katherine was quite unprepared
for this, and was obliged to scurry to be ready.</p>

<p>"In the country and at one's home, one must always
go to church, Miss Bush," she was informed when they
were in the motor. "It is tradition again."</p>

<p>Then there was silence until they were almost at the
door.</p>

<p>"It is rather a fine little church, with some good
tombs of my ancestors in it, prolific people who seemed
to have married either widows with like proclivities, or
to have commemorated their own marital achievements.&mdash;There
are two very curious monuments, one of a marriage
with about seven or eight children behind both the
man and the woman, proofs of their former activities,
and another of a second pair with numerous olive
branches owned mutually. They were of an enchanting
ingenuousness in those days. You will face these figures
during the sermon. You can examine them, a not unpleasing
pastime I used to find it in my youth."</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine's walk from the church was a
kind of triumphal progress. All the faces of the clustering
local groups beamed with joy and welcome for
her&mdash;she had a word and a nod for everyone and to
Katherine's amusement stopped threateningly in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
of a biggish boy who was handling a bandanna handkerchief.</p>

<p>"If I hear one sniffle, Thomas Knoughton&mdash;out you
go!&mdash;It is a habit you have got into, flaunting these
colds every time I get home. I won't put up with it!"</p>

<p>"Very good, Yer Leddyship," the boy returned
stolidly, pulling his forelock.</p>

<p>It was evident to be seen that their Lady Bountiful
was held in deep respect by her tenants. The service
was quite cheerful and merry with Christmas music
from a fine organ, one of the patroness's gifts, and the
monuments were certainly diverting, Henry VII and Edward
VI costumes carved in stone adorning meek-faced
women and grave men.</p>

<p>When they came out, a number of the local farmers
and their wives had to be greeted. Lady Garribardine
seemed to know all their domestic affairs, and to wield
an absolute dominion over them. She was kindly and
autocratic, and not in the least condescending; they
evidently loved her dearly.</p>

<p>Katherine stood by respectfully, and once or twice
her mistress said, "This is my new secretary, Miss
Bush," with a wave of her hand.</p>

<p>Apparently the bounties and teas and Christmas
feasting being prepared for everyone knew no bounds
by what Katherine heard discussed.</p>

<p>As they motored back Her Ladyship said:</p>

<p>"Now, before lunch I want you for an hour to explain
the country duties to you as I explained the London
ones&mdash;and this afternoon you must see over the
house. Mrs. Illingworth will show you round, and to-morrow
I have to start very early to see my poor
people&mdash;You have those lists copied out, have you
not?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>Katherine lunched alone in her sitting-room and before
her inspection of the house began she went for a
little walk. The old park delighted her, the sense that
it was not public property gave her pleasure. She could
go for miles, it seemed, upon the soft turf, or along the
smooth avenues, without meeting a soul. There was
something in her nature which enjoyed this isolation
from the common herd.</p>

<p>"I believe if it were mine I should dislike even a right
of way!" she said to herself.</p>

<p>She stopped close to some deer; they were so tame
they hardly started from her. The whole place, when
she came to a rising ground and could look back at the
house, exalted her in some strange way. The atmosphere
of it was so different from anything which she
had been accustomed to. It was no wonder that people
living in such houses should have wider scopes of imagination
than the inhabitants of Bindon's Green with
every little semi-detached villa watching the habits of
its neighbour. She made up her mind that she would
study Lady Garribardine's methods with her people for
her own future guidance. The perfect certainty with
which she looked forward to obtaining the same sort of
situation was almost sublime!</p>

<p>When her inspection of the house came her feelings
were further stirred; there was a great bump of veneration
in her for ancient things. Her artistic sensibilities
which had not yet been as awakened as her practical
ones now began to assert themselves. She felt she
must read books upon architecture, and learn the dates
and styles of furniture. She admired, but she was conscious
that she had not yet sufficiently cultivated critical
faculties to appreciate fully. Her tour opened a
new field of study for her&mdash;a new consciousness of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
own ignorance, and a new determination to acquire the
necessary knowledge on these points.</p>

<p>Ever since her outing with Lord Algy, she had been
aware that mere book-learning is not enough. There
were many things of interest in life that she would never
have heard of or realised the existence of but for that
first opening to her imagination.</p>

<p>Mr. Strobridge would be an invaluable teacher, but
she must get up a few technical points first. She would
at once ask her mistress if she might take some books
from the library, up to her sitting-room for the evening.
She would immediately look up the bald facts in
the Encyclopedia to begin with, and then study individual
volumes. Then there were the painters and the
sculptors to learn about more fully, although she had
often gone to the galleries and museums in London, but
not with what&mdash;she now knew, after her inspection of
this home where for hundreds of years the owners had
been cultivated collectors&mdash;was a critical eye. She felt
as if the key to understanding had only just been given
to her. Even the housekeeper (not Mrs. Pepperdon
of Berkeley Square, but this elderly, portly Mrs. Illingworth)
knew more about the beauties that she was showing
off than she did. This state of ignorance must not
continue for even a week!</p>

<p>Permission was accorded about the books when Lady
Garribardine looked into the secretary's room before
her tea&mdash;and until three o'clock in the morning this indefatigable
young woman kept her lights on, cramming
facts into her head&mdash;and then when her work was over
before lunch next day she walked again through the
picture gallery and the big drawing-rooms to see if she
had mastered anything. The picture gallery was filled
with early and late Italian works, and some fine specimens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
of Spanish Renaissance as well as English portraits.
She found that with even this much knowledge
gained she had already grown more appreciative, but
she realised that it was a question of training her eye
as well as her brain.</p>

<p>The guests were all to arrive on Christmas Eve and a
message came for Katherine that she was to come down
and pour out the tea for them, because "Her Ladyship's
hand was very rheumatic."</p>

<p>She had been extremely occupied with the dispatching
of parcels of presents and various matters all the afternoon.
This would be an occasion to wear the grey
blouse again, and she had discovered that the becoming
waves upon her brow could be achieved also by water
and combing, so she would not be at the mercy of a hairdresser
in the future for her improved looks!</p>

<p>She was seated behind the tea-table in the library
when the first batch of the visitors arrived by train.
Mr. Strobridge and Lady Beatrice were motoring; the
three grandchildren and their attendants had come
early in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The party consisted of the two old maiden cousins,
the Misses d'Estaire by name, and a young niece of
theirs, and two or three stray men, and Mrs. Delemar.
Katherine attended to their wants and watched the
whole scene&mdash;no one had greeted her, but whoever
chanced to be near her exchanged a friendly word;
Mrs. Delemar was even gracious, it was her way always
to be polite to everyone.</p>

<p>How easy they all were! No stiffness, no self-consciousness,
and one of the men was quite witty and the
young Miss d'Estaire a most lively modern girl. Katherine
enjoyed herself although she never spoke unless
spoken to, and then returned monosyllabic answers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>When they had all been chaffing and eating quantities
of muffins and buns and blackberry jam and cream
for half an hour, Gerard Strobridge and his wife came
in.</p>

<p>"We have had the most deplorable journey, Aunt
Sarah," Lady Beatrice announced plaintively. "A
judgment upon one for travelling with one's husband.
Gerard would drive, and of course collided with a milestone,
and injured one of the wheels so that the tire,
which broke, took hours to put on again and I was
frozen with cold."</p>

<p>Everyone sympathised with her, while Mr. Strobridge
only smiled complacently and asked Katherine
for some tea.</p>

<p>"As you can guess, I shall require it very hot and
very strong to keep my courage up after these reproaches,"
and he smiled as though to say, "I am sure
you understand."</p>

<p>Katherine attended to him gravely; she was purposely
the stiff secretary, aloof and uninterested in
what was going on; Mr. Strobridge rather wondered at
it, and it piqued him a little, but the lady who had been
asked for his special delectation had no intention of
allowing him any leisure to converse with anyone else.
She gave him one of her ravishing smiles, moved her
dress a little to make room for him on her sofa, and
then whispered to him softly for a long time, amidst
the general merry din.</p>

<p>Nothing escaped the eyes and intelligence of Miss
Bush. She was observing behaviour, character and capability
in each one of the guests and was making up her
mind what she would do next for the furtherance of her
plan that Gerard Strobridge should be a friend.</p>

<p>For one moment he looked up and met her eyes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
she allowed hers to show that sphinxlike smile before
she lowered the lids. Gerard Strobridge experienced
an emotion. L&auml;o was perhaps making him look a little
ridiculous. She was overdoing her pleasure at seeing
him. However, he was too old a hand at dalliance with
women to allow himself to stay beside her for a moment
after he felt this. So he made some forcible excuse
about the post's going, and got up and left the room.
He was completely at home, it was plain to be seen, at
Blissington Court.</p>

<p>Katherine smiled again to herself.</p>

<p>After dinner there was to be a cinematograph show
for Lady Garribardine's grandchildren, a thirteen-year-old
schoolboy and girls of ten and seven, and they were
dining punctually at eight. Katherine was to bring
them into the hall when the entertainment began, having
had them with her for dinner in the old schoolroom.
She was not particularly fond of children, but she did
her best to make them enjoy their meal. They were
stupid, unattractive creatures with none of their grandmother's
wit. They were to go on to their paternal relations
for the New Year, and then with their governess
and tutor were to sail to join their parents in the Antipodes.</p>

<p>The "dressy blouse" had to do duty as evening attire
on this night (the creation of Gladys' arranging must
be kept for the grand occasion of the Christmas dinner
in the dining-room) but Katherine had altered it a little,
the wretched thing! and cut down the neck to make it
more becoming. It looked quite suitable to her station
in any case, she thought, as she caught sight of herself
in the long glass in her room. She was beginning to
take an interest in dress which surprised herself!</p>

<p>She took a chair in the background, close to the stair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>case
from which the servants were to be allowed to witness
the show&mdash;Her whole demeanour was quiet and
unremarkable&mdash;and no one paid any attention to her at
all until the lights were turned up in the interval between
one set of pictures and another, when Lady Garribardine
called out to her:</p>

<p>"Can you see from where you are, Miss Bush? The
next thing ought to be very funny."</p>

<p>Katherine had the kind of voice which people listen
to, and one or two of the men glanced round at her
when she answered with thanks that she had a capital
view. And old Colonel Hawthorne said to a young
guardsman friend of Miss Betty d'Estaire that, by
Jove! Her Ladyship's secretary, or the children's governess,
or whoever she was, had a pair of eyes worth
looking at!</p>

<p>Gerard Strobridge had found L&auml;o charming again!
He had dined well and partaken of his aunt's promised
very best champagne, and he had indulged in some obviously
subtle insinuations as to his further intentions
in regard to their enjoyable friendship, whispered in
her shell-pink ear while the lights were low.</p>

<p>"Oh Gerard!&mdash;I won't allow you to!&mdash;Wait&mdash;not
yet!" Mrs. Delemar had gasped prettily, expecting
him to press the matter further.</p>

<p>But unfortunately it was just then that the lights
had blazed up, and Gerard had turned round and caught
sight of the provoking face of Katherine Bush as his
aunt spoke.</p>

<p>"How attractive that confounded girl looks!" he
thought. "What a nuisance she is not married and a
guest, instead of the typist&mdash;it is undignified and&mdash;difficult!"</p>

<p>But the brief glance had disturbed him and rearoused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
his interest; he found that he could not bring himself
up to the desired level of enthusiasm again with L&auml;o,
and contented himself by talking enigmatically about
the parrot rooms that she was in&mdash;their situation and
their comfort&mdash;while he looked unutterable things with
his deep grey eyes. Then presently when they all moved,
and the show was over, he allowed himself to be supplanted
in her favours by a promising youth of three
and twenty, a distant cousin of the house, who would
not have been permitted the ghost of a chance at another
time! But Gerard's emotions did not show on the
surface and Katherine Bush slipped up to bed presently
in rather a depressed frame of mind.</p>

<p>She realised fully that the goal was yet a long, long
way from attainment, and that it would require all her
intelligence to walk warily through this coming week.</p>

<p>No one had been in the least slighting or unkind to
her, but naturally no one had troubled to converse with
her; she was just the secretary and was treated exactly
as she would treat her own, when she had one, she felt.
It would not be safe to attract any of the party; her
employer's good will and contentment with her mattered
far more than the gratification of her vanity.</p>

<p>Mr. Strobridge, however, was one of the chief pieces
in her game, and him she would see often as long as she
remained in Lady Garribardine's service, so there was
no hurry&mdash;she could afford to wait.</p>

<p>But all the same she settled down to read "The Seven
Lamps of Architecture" without the buoyant feeling of
self-confidence which usually gave her such a proud
carriage of head.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>


<p>A message came up to Katherine next morning&mdash;the
morning of Christmas Day&mdash;from
Lady Garribardine to say that she could walk
across the park to church with the two elder children
and that she was to take them into the front pew that
faced the large carved family one behind the choir at
right angles.</p>

<p>And from this well-placed outlook Miss Bush later
on observed the house party enter by a door in the chancel.
They filled the whole long seat and overflowed
into the pew where she and the children sat, and it happened
that Gerard Strobridge was next her and knelt to
say his prayers.</p>

<p>Propinquity is a very curious thing, and when all
possibility of conversation is nil, propinquity has sometimes
been known to exert a very powerful influence.
Gerard Strobridge was conscious with every throb of
his pulse of the nearness of Katherine Bush; there was
a magnetic disturbing emanation he felt coming from
her, which excited him unaccountably. He kept glancing
at her regular profile from time to time. Her very
pale skin and large red mouth attracted him immensely.
She never once looked at him, and maintained an air of
absolute unconsciousness.</p>

<p>"What is she thinking about, I wonder?" he mused.
"I have never seen a face more sphinxlike; she could be
good or devilishly bad, she could love passionately and
hate coldly, she could be cruel as the grave and hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
as adamant. She is a woman that a man were wiser
not to know too well for his own safety."</p>

<p>But reflections of this sort never yet made son of
Adam avoid the object of them, so when they came out
and Katherine was waiting for instructions from her
employer as to the disposal of the children, Mr. Strobridge
came up to her.</p>

<p>"A happy Christmas, Miss Bush," he said. "Are you
going to walk back through the Park? Here, Teddy, I
will come with you."</p>

<p>"We are going in the motor with Grandmamma,"
both children cried at once as Katherine returned his
greeting, and they ran off to Lady Garribardine. So
Katherine started to walk on alone, while the rest of the
party lingered about the porch and made up their minds
as to whether or no they would drive.</p>

<p>She had gone some way and was on a path by a copse
in the Park, when Mr. Strobridge caught her up.</p>

<p>"Why did you race ahead, Miss Bush?" he asked.
"Did you not want any companion in your solitude?"</p>

<p>"I never thought about it," she returned quite simply.</p>

<p>"I did&mdash;I wanted to walk with you, I have been watching
you all the time in church. I believe that you were
in dreamland again; now will be the very moment to
finish our discussion upon it."</p>

<p>"I don't think we had begun it."</p>

<p>"Well, we will."</p>

<p>"How are we to start?"</p>

<p>"You are going to tell me where yours is&mdash;in the
heart or in the head?"</p>

<p>"Such a conversation would be altogether unprofitable."
There was mischief lurking in the corner of her
eye and trembling in the curves of her full mouth.</p>

<p>"I must judge of that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>"How so? Do I not count?"</p>

<p>"Enormously&mdash;that is why I want to hear of your
dreamland."</p>

<p>"It is a place where only I can go."</p>

<p>"How unsociable&mdash;but you look disobliging."</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"Very well, I give up the task of trying to make you
tell me about it. By the way, I have not had the chance
to thank you for so kindly finishing those papers for
that confounded charity. My aunt said they were in
perfect order."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that."</p>

<p>He raised his head and looked away in front of them
down into a dell and so up again to the house.</p>

<p>"Isn't this a beautiful view? I always think of 'the
stately homes of England' when I walk back from
church."</p>

<p>Katherine's eyes followed his to the gabled, irregular
red brick house, with its wreath of blue smoke going
straight up into the winter sky.</p>

<p>"I have never seen one before," she told him. "You
can imagine how wonderful this appears to me after the
place where I have lived. I had only seen Hampton
Court, but somehow all the people there and its being
a museum did not make it have the impression of a house
that is inhabited."</p>

<p>"This pleases you, does it?"</p>

<p>"Naturally. I love everything about it, the space,
and people not being allowed in. It is Her Ladyship's
own&mdash;she can shut the gates if she wants to and have
it all to herself&mdash;that must be good."</p>

<p>"What a strange girl! You would not like to share
anything, then? I have already remarked this deplorably
selfish instinct in you, in reference to your dream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>land&mdash;and
you would keep poor devils out of your park,
too, if you could!"</p>

<p>"Generally&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"Well, I want to be the exception to this exclusiveness.
If I come up one afternoon to the old schoolroom,
for instance, and ask you to talk to me, will you turn
me out?"</p>

<p>"It depends what you want me to talk to you about.
If it is upon a subject only to please you&mdash;yes&mdash;if to
please me then I may let you stay for a little."</p>

<p>"What subjects would please you?"</p>

<p>"I would like to hear all about the pictures in the
house, for instance&mdash;you see, before I came to Lady
Garribardine I had never conversed with anyone educated
in art. So I have only a very little book knowledge
to go upon."</p>

<p>"We will talk about art then; the house is full of
interesting things, part of it is so old."</p>

<p>For the rest of the way he did his best to entertain
his aunt's insignificant secretary, and they both knew
that the walk had been very charming. When they got
into the shrubbery, Katherine took the path which led
to the small rose-garden courtyard, on which the schoolroom
staircase opened.</p>

<p>"Of course, I had forgotten you have a front door
all to yourself."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;our roads divide here. Good morning, Mr.
Strobridge."</p>

<p>"Are you going to shake hands with me?"</p>

<p>"No, it is quite unnecessary."</p>

<p>"<i>Au revoir</i>, then. To-night I shall dance with you.
I have not danced for ten years."</p>

<p>"Then probably you will not do it well. Recollect I
come from Bindon's Green where we learn the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
newest steps. I never have put up with a bad partner."</p>

<p>"I can't 'turkey trot,' if that is what you mean."</p>

<p>"Then I am afraid you are too old and too old-fashioned
for my taste." And smiling demurely, she walked
off to the quaint, wrought-iron gate which opened into
the rose garden.</p>

<p>Gerard Strobridge laughed as he went on his way.
Why was he attracted to this girl? He was a person
of the highest fastidiousness, and had never had a <i>liaison</i>
with any woman beneath him in class in his life, even
in his Oxford days. It was against his idea of the fitness
of things. To flirt with his aunt's secretary! But
the creature was so sensible, and so intelligent it made
matters appear in a different light&mdash;there surely could
not be much harm in discussing pictures and sculpture
with her, or a poet or two! But at this stage he did
put some restraint upon himself, and made no further
attempts to see her until she came down to pour
out the tea again. He bravely made love to L&auml;o, and
exercised as much skill to keep matters from approaching
a climax as he was wont to use in bringing on that
happy occurrence. It caused him a cynical amusement.</p>

<p>Katherine had on the dress which rather resembled
his wife's, and looked almost as distinguished, and a
good deal more healthy and attractive.</p>

<p>Her demeanour was so admirable, too; she had none
of either that overhumble obsequiousness or touchy assertion,
which so often distinguished these quasi-gentlefolk,
he thought. She might have been a Lady Clara
Vere de Vere in her quiet dignity and utter freedom
from all self-consciousness.</p>

<p>It was evident that she was not thinking of herself
at all, or wondering whether or no she was being noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
or slighted, or properly or improperly treated. She
was just gravely pouring out the tea and attending to
people's wants as quietly sure of herself as his aunt
would have been. Indeed, it almost seemed to Gerard
watching her that she stood out, if he could have selected
one from the whole party, as the most perfect
specimen of womanhood.</p>

<p>Was it her supreme will&mdash;her force of character
which had overcome all class traditions? He remembered
what she had said about no ordinary Radical ever
being able to be a foreign minister. How she must have
thought out matters! Her brain was that of a woman
in a thousand.</p>

<p>The Christmas tea grew very merry, and old Colonel
Hawthorne, friend of the family for countless years,
found it his pleasant duty to be genial with the good-looking
secretary. Gerard continued to watch; she
answered the pleasantries with so much wit, and never
the least presumption.</p>

<p>After a while he drifted up to his aunt's own sitting-room
for a quarter of an hour before dressing time&mdash;L&auml;o
had been cajoled into thinking all was well between
them, and had gone off to make herself especially beautiful
for dinner.</p>

<p>She had been through one or two disquieting moments.
Gerard had appeared all that an eager lover
should be, and she felt she must have been stupid in
some way to have given him the impression that she was
serious in her protestation of "not yet." She had no
rival&mdash;that was plain to be seen. He never spoke to
Betty d'Estaire&mdash;who was the only other young woman
of the party. Perhaps it was because of Beatrice! Gerard
was such a perfect gentleman, perhaps in some corner
of a foolishly overpunctilious heart he was deterred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
by&mdash;Beatrice! But fortunately Beatrice was leaving
the day after Boxing Day.</p>

<p>In any case her usual method of rigid circumspection&mdash;until
the very last moment&mdash;had not been quite
successful with this would-be lover; he had been deceived
by it and slightly rebuffed. It was merciful as far as
her own emotions were concerned, but she knew men well
enough to know that unless she herself had damped his
ardour, this state of things was not altogether natural,
and therefore it might imply some lack in her own
charm, which was not an agreeable thought. However,
she need not feel really disquieted while his attentions
were still so <i>empress&eacute;</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Seraphim, I walked back from church with Miss
Bush," Gerard said, stretching himself out in a huge
chair by his aunt's fire, while he lighted a cigarette.
"You are quite right, she is a most intelligent young
woman; how do you account for that something about
her which is not at all of her class?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, it has puzzled me. I was watching
her to-day pouring out the tea; she is the first secretary
I have ever had, not excepting poor Arnott, who
on such occasions did not feel that one or other of the
guests was trying to snub her&mdash;Katherine Bush is never
on the defensive&mdash;it is quite unique in a person of her
station."</p>

<p>"I watched her, too, and was struck with the same
thing; and to-day she talked so well. She wanted to
hear about the pictures&mdash;she is absolutely frank and
tells one in the na&iuml;vest manner about what things she is
ignorant of&mdash;but one finds that she must have read
considerably."</p>

<p>"She is full of theories about tradition and evolution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
I let her tell me them motoring down&mdash;she seems to have
dissected herself and her family in an endeavour to
eradicate what she disapproves of in the way of instincts."</p>

<p>"It is astonishing, isn't it, Seraphim?"</p>

<p>"Very&mdash;she made one or two rather dreadful gaffes
when she first came, especially during the tableaux week&mdash;it
was quite interesting to see her face when she
realised this. She did not once try to explain them
away&mdash;she drew in her lips and I could see she was
registering a vow never to make the same mistake again.
That kind of nature always wins any game it is playing."</p>

<p>"I wonder what hers is&mdash;don't you?"</p>

<p>"The immediate one obviously is to turn herself into
a lady&mdash;She means to do in a few years consciously,
what nature takes many generations to accomplish in
the ordinary course of events&mdash;Her progress is quite
remarkable even in these six weeks."</p>

<p>"What shall you do with her, Seraphim?"</p>

<p>"Keep her as long as she will stay with me, G., and
perhaps take her education in hand myself when you
all leave." And then Lady Garribardine laughed softly.
"L&auml;o is a huge joke, dear boy&mdash;I think the parrot
rooms suit her, don't you? Are you pleased with my
arrangements for my guests?"</p>

<p>There was something exquisitely whimsical in Her
Ladyship's old black eyes, his met them delightedly.
Aunt and nephew understood each other so well, these
two perfect citizens of the world!</p>

<p>"L&auml;o is charming! And I am sure she is deriving all
sorts of inspirations from the blue macaw's amourettes
with the yellow-crested cockatoo, which she looks at
from her downy couch&mdash;Seraphim, I am going to persuade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Beatrice to stay on&mdash;Beatrice is an excellent
creature in spite of her contempt for my powers as a
chauffeur! She is quite amused with Victor Thistlethwaite.
I paved the way by suggesting to her this
morning that she should take the early train on Thursday,
and she said at once, that she rather thought she
was not leaving until Saturday with the rest."</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine chuckled delightedly; the noise
was as of cream bubbling&mdash;if cream can bubble!</p>

<p>"<i>Tiens!</i>" was all she said and then went on to speak
of other things. "Betty d'Estaire is going to catch
young Allonby, G. I believe they will settle it to-night.
For one of my blood she has a number of overmodern
faults, and Gwendoline and Arabella will be glad to get
her off their hands."</p>

<p>"She is a promising young person."</p>

<p>"Even blood can't stand against the total want of
discipline which prevails among the present generation,
G. When these impossible girls' children have grown up
there won't be any ladies left."</p>

<p>"I don't think they will have many children&mdash;we are
breeding a neuter race, Seraphim. All the games are
making their bones too rigid, and all the want of discipline
is weakening their nerves&mdash;very few of the
future ones will be able to stand the agonies of child-bearing."</p>

<p>"You are not in a position to criticise, G., with no
offspring of your own!"</p>

<p>"I am not an eldest son; there is no obligation entailed
upon me! Dick has three boys, fortunately, and
Alec, two."</p>

<p>"I consider that the poorest excuse."</p>

<p>Mr. Strobridge sighed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is&mdash;the whole thing is rather played out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
with us all, isn't it? Seraphim, when I talked with that
balanced, healthy young woman to-day, I felt we want
an admixture of new blood in a number of our families,
if only to bring back our enthusiasm. Dick's children
are fine enough fellows physically, but there is not half
a peck o' wits among them&mdash;and as you know, Alec's
little Yankee chaps are what their mother calls 'brainy'
to a degree, but masses of overstrung nerves as well."</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine leaned forward from among her
sofa cushions and looked at her nephew with a quizzical
eye.</p>

<p>"G., if you were free and my heir, I'd marry you off
to Katherine Bush just for the pleasure of the experiment!"</p>

<p>Then the little S&egrave;vres clock chimed. "Why, it is
striking the quarter&mdash;rush off at once, dear boy!&mdash;and
don't forget to put on your hunt coat; the scarlet
pleases the children."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In another part of the house, Her Ladyship's secretary,
quite unaware that she was under discussion, was
joyously dressing in her pretty oak-panelled room, with
a delicious sense of excitement. Martha was coming in
to help her presently for this wonderful first occasion in
her life when she should put on a real evening dress,
showing pearl white neck and arms. Gladys had given
her every instruction as to its fastenings and had supervised
the making of it with a zeal which she would only
have bestowed upon an order from the richest customer.
The frock fitted to perfection, and was astonishingly
becoming in its black simplicity.</p>

<p>Martha had brought her in some beautiful lilies of
the valley, when she came with her hot water, accompanied
by the information that Mr. Strobridge's valet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
had handed them to her for Miss Bush, from his master.</p>

<p>Gerard had been robbing the hothouses evidently.
The head gardener was a particular friend of his. They
were just the touch wanted to complete the picture;
their snowy whiteness and brilliant forced green gave
the note of freshness which went so well with Katherine's
skin&mdash;of an astonishing purity&mdash;by candle-light
as clear as ivory and as pale in tone.</p>

<p>She gazed into her looking-glass and felt satisfied
with what she saw, and presently she held her shoulders
back and her head up, and walked down the corridor
with the grace of a Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise queen! So greatly
does the consciousness of fine raiment affect the
morale of young women!</p>

<p>Lady Beatrice came out of her room in the great
gallery and they went down together.</p>

<p>"You do look so pretty, Miss Bush," she said. "What
a duck of a frock! It looks like an Ermantine."</p>

<p>"Yes, my sister is a saleswoman there, and she had
it made for me," Katherine told her.&mdash;"I am glad you
think it looks well. I have never had on a real evening
dress before."</p>

<p>"You know how to wear it so that is all right! Ah,
children, come along!" as three joyous calls came from
over the banisters. And Katherine slipped on alone.
Lady Garribardine had told her, before she went to
dress, to go to Bronson to see that a special order about
the presents was carried out.</p>

<p>All the party were assembled in the great drawing-room
when this duty was done, and so her entrance did
not pass unremarked.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" was the significant exclamation of old
Colonel Hawthorne.</p>

<p>"And I am to have the pleasure of taking you in to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
dinner," said the charming young man who had so far
succeeded in diverting Lady Beatrice.</p>

<p>Gerard Strobridge felt a strange sensation as he
looked at Katherine presently, between the great bowls
of camellias&mdash;there was no comparison with anyone at
the table; Her Ladyship's secretary had blossomed
forth into the beauty of the night.</p>

<p>"How clothes can alter a person!" Mrs. Delemar said
without conscious spite&mdash;dependents, even pretty ones,
were not things which counted.&mdash;"Look, G.&mdash;dear
Sarah's typist appears quite pretty to-night, and how
kind she is to her servants; see, she has let the girl have
those beautiful lilies of the valley which Hawke told me
to-day when you were making him give me the orchids,
it just breaks his heart to have to cut!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>


<p>The sudden accession to beauty in Lady Garribardine's
secretary had a double&mdash;nay, treble&mdash;result!
It caused Mr. Victor Thistlethwaite
plainly to show that he perceived it at dinner, and thereby
considerably to annoy both the Lady Beatrice and
Mr. Gerard Strobridge during that meal! Lady
Beatrice considered it impertinence on the part of Miss
Bush and Mr. Strobridge found it "ridiculous cheek of
that insufferable puppy Thistlethwaite."</p>

<p>Katherine for her part enjoyed herself! She had got
over the awe of servants&mdash;and the strangeness of well-bred
companions&mdash;She was now sure of the methods of
eating, too, and so had leisure to enjoy conversation
and she was filled with that delicious sovereign complacency
which only a woman discovering that she is
undeniably a success can know.</p>

<p>While remaining exceedingly demure, she managed
to arrest the exclusive attention of her partner for the
feast, and Lady Garribardine watched the whole thing
with a whimsical eye.</p>

<p>Gerard Strobridge was too good a diplomat to allow
the vaguest trace of his disturbed equilibrium to show
in his face, and talked to L&auml;o with renewed passion, so
that before they began to pull crackers she was feeling
perfectly contented in the certain conviction that it was
Beatrice's presence alone which kept him within bounds!
He had not made love to women ever since he left Eton,
or served his country at the Foreign Office until the age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
of thirty-five, without acquiring a certain experience
in feminine psychology, and a knowledge as to the best
manipulation of diplomatic situations, and even though
he had been irritated by Mr. Thistlethwaite's evident
admiration, he saw that it would certainly cause
Beatrice to stay until the Saturday, and so in it there
lay good.</p>

<p>There were quantities of silver charms in the blazing
plum-pudding, and some received omens of wealth, and
some of princely mates or lengthy journeys, but Gerard
Strobridge could only secure the emblem of an old maid&mdash;a
thimble was his portion&mdash;and he turned the unhappy
augury to much good account in a suitable reproach
to L&auml;o.</p>

<p>When the caps from the crackers were put on, an
early English gold paper crown fell to Katherine's
share, and became her mightily.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Bush looks just like Queen Victoria when
she came to the throne, Grandmamma!" called out the
elder girl grandchild. "We have her picture on the
nursery screen."</p>

<p>"And I wonder what her end will be," Gerard Strobridge
thought; "she looks remarkably well in a crown."</p>

<p>The hall had been cleared for dancing and when the
excitement in opening the wonderful little presents
which lay hidden in a rose by each person's plate was
over, the company poured in there, while three local
musicians struck up a merry tune. It was a two-step
and Miss Betty d'Estaire must try it with some new
variations which were just coming in from America at
that date (it was before tango days). Katherine was
an adept in them, for was not Bindon's Green always
in the forefront of modernity? And any kind of dancing
she really loved. It was the one pastime of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
sisters which she had shared with delight, and often
practised with Ethel in their tiny drawing-room before
going to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. Thistlethwaite asked her for a turn with him,
and they started off.</p>

<p>"It is much better than a stupid old valse, isn't it?"
he said to her while they careered smoothly ahead.
"And by Jove! how well you dance!"</p>

<p>The blood was rushing in Katherine's veins; it was
so good to be young and admired, and forgetful of relative
positions for once in a way. She knew very well
that she was a far finer performer than the other young
girl, and all that was sensuous in her nature came uppermost
and quivered through the rhythmic movements
of her supple body. Gerard Strobridge watched her
silently. He was conscious of profound and increasing
emotion; it was as if some primitive, strong, vital thing
was there before him, dwarfing the puny make-believes
at passion which were so well assumed by L&auml;o Delemar.
She was standing beside him looking as beautiful and
as artificial as the orchids in her dress.</p>

<p>"How that girl could love!" he breathed to himself
as he watched the dancers, and L&auml;o seemed as utterly
meaningless as a wax doll!</p>

<p>Once was enough of this sort of thing, Katherine
Bush thought; she was keenly alive to atmospheres and
she felt that for a secretary to do more than show that
she was proficient in these steps would be a breach of
taste. So no persuasions of her partner would move
her after the first few rounds, and she left him and went
off with the youngest grandchild in a polka step.</p>

<p>Thus the Lady Beatrice recovered her whilom admirer,
and when another tune had begun and L&auml;o had
been safely lured into the arms of the distant cousin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Gerard Strobridge came over casually to where Katherine
stood.</p>

<p>"Am I to be allowed a turn of this old-fashioned
valse, Miss Bush?" he asked.</p>

<p>But Katherine was not to be beguiled so easily&mdash;she
must parley first!</p>

<p>"I do not know if her Ladyship expects me to
dance any more," she answered. "If you think she
will not mind my accepting this honour, I shall be very
pleased."</p>

<p>"Foolish thing! Is it not Christmas night, and are
you not the belle of the ball?" And he held out his arm
and they whirled off. It gave him immense pleasure
to hold her in his embrace&mdash;but something in the scent
of the violets in his scarlet hunt coat brought back to
Katherine with a sickening thrill of anguish and longing
the remembrance of Lord Algy and the Saturday night
in Paris when they had danced in masks and dominoes
at a Bal Tabarin. Oh! the pain of it!&mdash;Suddenly the
whole present melted away from her&mdash;the dreams of
the future, the pride in her conquest of the past! The
passionate woman in her cried aloud in wild longing for
him, Algy&mdash;her darling, her dearly-loved mate! How
plain were these other young men!&mdash;How tired and old
Gerard Strobridge looked! At that moment she would
have thrown her whole ambitions away into nothingness,
to be clasped once more to Algy's heart! Her
cheeks became ashen white and her strange eyes grew
shadowed and fierce, and Gerard Strobridge was
brought up sharply out of his intoxication of emotion
by the look in her face.</p>

<p>"What is it, child?" he asked anxiously, holding her
close.</p>

<p>"Let me go&mdash;let me go!" she cried wildly, breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
from him near the staircase recess. "I&mdash;I&mdash;cannot bear
it&mdash;I would like to get out of all this!"</p>

<p>He was intensely astonished, but he saw that she was
trembling, and well as he knew women he could not
fathom the reason of this strange outburst. Katherine
recovered her composure almost immediately and gave
a short mirthless laugh.</p>

<p>"I am awfully stupid," she faltered. "I cannot think
what came over me. I believe it must be because I am
unaccustomed to parties, and it is getting late."</p>

<p>"It is not yet eleven o'clock&mdash;but come and have
something to drink&mdash;I see a tray down there in the
long hall," and she let him lead her to it and pour out
some champagne and seltzer for her, and then they sat
down.</p>

<p>He saw very well that something had deeply moved
her, and his perfect tact would not permit him to
refer to the occurrence, but caused him rather to talk
soothingly of ordinary things&mdash;and in a few minutes
he saw that the normal whiteness had come back to her
face. But nothing would induce her to dance any more,
and although she continued doing whatever was expected
of her during the rest of the evening&mdash;and
snatched flaming raisins in the snapdragon with dashing
indifference to pain&mdash;he knew that she was doing
it all as an automaton, and that the living, vital, magnetic
Katherine was no longer there, and that this pale,
quiet girl whose hand he held presently in the deserted
corridor was only too glad to say good-night.</p>

<p>"Dear child," he whispered, as he kissed it with
homage, "I don't know what it was that caused it, but
you have evidently seen a ghost, and now go to bed,
and forget everything but that we have all had an
awfully happy Christmas, and I want to tell you how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
pleased I am that you have worn my flowers to-night."</p>

<p>"&mdash;Your flowers! Oh! yes, I ought to have thanked
you for them before&mdash;they were lovely, but now they
are dead," and she unpinned them carelessly&mdash;almost
as if she did not like them any longer to touch her&mdash;and
threw them in the big open grate.</p>

<p>"Good-night&mdash;and thank you for your kindness,"
and she was off down the passage and up the side stairs.</p>

<p>And when Gerard Strobridge joined the rest of the
party in the drawing-room, he had a cigarette between
his lips, as though he had been having a smoke, and it
required all his polished skill to bring himself back to
talking gaily, and to looking what he did not feel, into
Mrs. Delemar's sparkling eyes, before they all parted
for the night.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Katherine Bush had reached her room and
had flung herself into the armchair. This would not do&mdash;she
must steel herself against giving way to weakness
like this. Why had the scent of the violets in another
man's coat had power to affect her so that every part
of her being cried out for Algy? As though the suppressed
emotions of her heart would no longer obey her
will&mdash;and must proclaim themselves her master! It
was shameful feebleness, and she indignantly resented
the dominion that love still held over her. She sat there
reasoning with herself, but nature reigned stronger than
any other thing at the moment, and the memory of her
lover obsessed her. She seemed to hear his voice and
feel his kisses, until the agony of longing for reality
grew unbearable, and she fell forward and lay there on
the rug before the fire beating the floor with her hands.
It was as the despair of some fierce savage caged animal
crying out for its mate. Her whole face altered, the
most intense passion blazed from her eyes&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
whitened her cheeks. Could Gerard Strobridge have
seen her he would indeed have been moved.</p>

<p>"Algy! Algy&mdash;My darling, my love&mdash;Come back to
me, I want you. My dear, my dear!&mdash;"</p>

<p>She sobbed with agony&mdash;and then worn out at last&mdash;"Oh!
God!" she wailed. "Can whatever comes be worth
it&mdash;after all!"</p>

<p>But by the morning she had crushed emotion and
came down ready to assist with the huge Christmas
tree for the tenants' children, with her usually composed
face.</p>

<p>But that passion denied should have exacted this
anguish frightened her a little. All her will should be
used to prevent such madness ever holding sway again.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>


<p>Lady Beatrice remained until the Saturday,
greatly to her husband's satisfaction and relief.
He had man&oelig;uvred this arrangement with much
skill, and L&auml;o's vanity felt satisfied, and indeed gratified,
by the belief that the presence of his wife was
causing Gerard untold suffering and disappointment!
The preliminaries of the game were so very agreeable!
and when they could be prolonged by fate so that there
was no fear of losing the other participant in them,
nothing could be more to her taste.</p>

<p>Passion, like that which Katherine Bush knew, would
have appeared as something absolutely shocking and
horrible to her&mdash;indeed, she would have agreed with
Mabel Cawber in considering it as most unladylike!</p>

<p>The circumstance of the Christmas night dance had
left a feeling of mystery with Gerard Strobridge, which
did not detract from his interest in Katherine Bush.
That some strong upheaval had taken place in this
strange young woman's soul he did not doubt.</p>

<p>But what in Heaven's name had caused it? Did it
concern him?&mdash;Or was he only the medium connecting
some memory?&mdash;He wished he could feel sure. Then
there was the incident of his flowers; why had she worn
them, and then thrown them from her as if they had
burnt her?</p>

<p>His rather tormenting thoughts kept him too frequent
company&mdash;especially as the provoking girl seemed
to have retired from sight, and except on rare occasions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>,
before everyone, he never had the chance of even
a word.</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine's rheumatism was better, so Miss
Bush had not even been required to pour out the
tea.</p>

<p>It was with a sigh of intense relief that he returned
into the hall after tucking L&auml;o and his wife into the
motor en route for London town, on Saturday morning
an hour or two before lunch.</p>

<p>The hostess was not down to speed her parting
guests; she was very much occupied in her boudoir, and
they had gone thither to bid her farewell.</p>

<p>As Mr. Strobridge mounted the stairs, he met Katherine
coming out of the room with her arms full of
papers and small parcels, and a couple of big books,
which she had some ado to carry.</p>

<p>"Let me help you," he said, eagerly&mdash;and she gave
him the heavy volumes without a word.</p>

<p>A sense of exasperation arose in him. He would not
be flouted like this! He followed her to the old schoolroom,
merely remarking on the way that now all the
guests, except Colonel Hawthorne, had departed, he
felt there was breathing space.</p>

<p>Katherine seemed quite unconcerned and indifferent
as to whether he did or did not; and she took his burden
from him and thanked him absently, with a look
towards the door evidently expecting him to go back
again whence he came.</p>

<p>But he showed no signs of moving.</p>

<p>"Am I to be offered a chair on this my first call upon
Miss Bush?"</p>

<p>"It isn't a call&mdash;you helped me to carry the books.
I am very busy to-day."</p>

<p>"I don't care. I am here now, and I am going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
stay&mdash;I shall tell my aunt how inhospitable and ungracious
you are!"</p>

<p>"Sneak!" and she began sorting the little parcels into
a row, her sullen eyes smiling. "I always hated tell-tales
at school."</p>

<p>"So did I&mdash;but I could commit any crime to be with
you. I have been tantalized all the week&mdash;Miss Bush
not even seen at tea&mdash;and only glimpses of her scurrying
along passages and up stairs!"</p>

<p>"What then do you want with Miss Bush?&mdash;Have
you some more charity business to do?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;The charity will be quite on the side of the fair
Katherine, if she will allow a weary wayfarer to bask
in the sunshine of her presence for a little while."</p>

<p>"Mr. Strobridge, you are talking nonsense, and I have
not a moment's time to waste on you."</p>

<p>"I love to talk nonsense. It annoys you, and I want
to see your eyes flash. I have seen them laughing&mdash;and
full of pain&mdash;and snakily cold. Now I want them to
flash&mdash;and then I would like them to grow tender.&mdash;They
would be divine like that."</p>

<p>Katherine sat down and took up a pen, with a glance
of withering indifference; then she began to address the
labels of the packets from a list.</p>

<p>He came quite close to her; he was feeling a number
of things.</p>

<p>"What a temptress you are&mdash;aren't you?&mdash;teasing
me like this!"</p>

<p>Katherine now opened her eyes wide and stared at
him, but she did not move away an inch.</p>

<p>"The whole thing is only in your imagination," she
said, calmly. "You are a proof of my theory that personal
emotion creates appearance, and hides reality."</p>

<p>"You understand then that I do feel emotion?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, of course. A man of your brains and cultivation
could not behave in so foolish a way otherwise."</p>

<p>He drew back and leaned against the mantelpiece
while he laughed shortly.</p>

<p>Katherine continued to work.</p>

<p>"I am merely waiting until you have finished directing
those confounded parcels, which I presume are for this
post&mdash;and then I am going to coax you to talk to me&mdash;May
I smoke?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you like&mdash;" still with lowered head.</p>

<p>"Won't you have a cigarette?"</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>He handed her one from his case. She pulled a box
of matches near and lit it casually, going on with her
work as a boy might have done&mdash;There was no knocking
off of ash or graceful movement of the hand in the
fashion of L&auml;o, who loved her white jewelled fingers to
be seen to advantage.</p>

<p>Neither of them spoke. He might not have been in
the room as far as she was concerned! He, on the
contrary, was profoundly aware of her presence. Emotion
such as he had not felt for years was surging
through him.</p>

<p>She was the most damnably attractive creature, he
thought, he had ever met. She awoke primitive passions,
and stirred his blood. There was that intense
note of reality and strength about her. She was like
some dangerous lazy lioness. She made him feel that
civilisation was slipping from him, and that he could
willingly seize her for a jungle mate.</p>

<p>She, however, continued to smoke and to write for
quite ten minutes, until all the parcels were addressed,
and several papers examined and annotated and filed.
Then she looked up. His eyes had never left her face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't think how you can stare like that," she said,
with abominable matter-of-factness. "It would make
me blink."</p>

<p>"I can enjoy looking at the sun&mdash;Now are those infernal
things finished? I have been waiting with the
patience of Job."</p>

<p>"But I can't think what for?"</p>

<p>"To talk to you."</p>

<p>"Well, talk then! I must do some typing," and she
got up and went to her machine, which was on another
table by the window. She knew perfectly well that she
was driving him mad; it gave her a savage pleasure,
and seemed a sort of balance to her own emotions on
Christmas night about Algy.</p>

<p>He came and leant against the mantelpiece and looked
down at her and quoted Dryden:</p>

<p>
"She knows her man, and when you rant and swear<br />
Can draw you to her with a single hair."<br />
</p>

<p>and stretching out his hand, he touched for an instant
the faint broad waves on her forehead.</p>

<p>And now he saw her eyes flash brilliantly enough!</p>

<p>"If you are going to be impertinent, Mr. Strobridge,
the staircase into the garden is quite close, and the
sooner you find your way to it, the better I shall be
pleased."</p>

<p>"I would not be impertinent for the world&mdash;the temptation
was overwhelming; it is so lovely, your hair&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice was quite sincere, and it was not in her
plan to quarrel with him.</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>"I want to hear so many things about you, child&mdash;tell
me what made you come to my aunt's?&mdash;I some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>how
cannot ever feel that you should be in any dependent
position."</p>

<p>"I came to educate myself&mdash;I do not mean to be dependent
always&mdash;What do you do in the Foreign Office?"</p>

<p>He gave her a brief sketch of his days.</p>

<p>"Well, then," she said, "you have to do what you
are told to also&mdash;nothing matters as long as the spirit
is not dependent. You will be a Chief some day, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;and are you learning here?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and you could teach me if you liked."</p>

<p>"I should quite adore it&mdash;what wages should I have?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"Then that means, by the rules of all games, that I
should be working for&mdash;love&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders and put in another piece
of paper in the typing machine. She had no intention
of talking about&mdash;love&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are the queerest creature&mdash;you make me feel&mdash;I
do not know what&mdash;Well, if you won't discuss wages&mdash;tell
me what I am to teach you?"</p>

<p>"Literature&mdash;Do you remember a day when I came
in and had coffee in the dining-room?&mdash;It was before
you knew I existed&mdash;You and Her Ladyship talked of
the things then which I would like you to talk to me
about."</p>

<p>"Yes, was it not strange?&mdash;I must have been blind
all those weeks."</p>

<p>The sphinxlike smile hovered round Katherine's
mouth; it was enigmatic and horribly tantalizing.
Gerard Strobridge felt a rush of wild emotion again;
the temptation to seize her in his arms and passionately
kiss those mocking lips almost overcame him. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
quite doubtful what might have eventuated, if at that
moment he had not caught sight of old Colonel Hawthorne
in the rose garden. He had come out through
the same little door which Katherine used, the passage
from which, on the ground floor, led to the smoking-room.
He waved his hand and beckoned to Gerard.</p>

<p>It broke the spell, and drove some sense into the
latter's head.</p>

<p>"Colonel Hawthorne is calling you; had not you
better go and get some air?" Miss Bush suggested
graciously. "It would be most beneficial, I am sure, to
you, on this fine morning!"</p>

<p>"I daresay you are right&mdash;Well, I will go&mdash;only some
day perhaps you will pay me some wages after all!"</p>

<p>"Is that a threat?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least"; he went towards the door. "Don't
be cross&mdash;and when you have time will you come and
see the pictures in the gallery?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I would love that," and her face brightened.
"But you had better ask Lady Garribardine if I may."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;Leave it to me&mdash;<i>Au revoir!</i>" and he was
gone.</p>

<p>As he went down the stairs, he thought that it was
a good idea of his aunt's to have had the smoking-room
removed to this wing of the house. It had only been
done that autumn, so that the shooters could go
straight in if they pleased, by the side door.</p>

<p>Katherine did not continue her typing for a moment
after she was left alone. Her brows were contracted.
She was thinking deeply.</p>

<p>Mr. Strobridge might not be quite so easy to rule as
Charlie Prodgers. She had heard that thoroughbred
racers required the lightest hand, and also that there
were moments when nothing would control them, neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
bridle, nor whip, nor spur. She must think out her
plan of action coolly. It was necessary for what she
required of him that his desire to please her should surmount
all other things. At the present stage it would
be difficult to get him to talk sense&mdash;but she would do
her best to make him do so. This point settled, she
went on with her work again undisturbed.</p>

<p>Gerard Strobridge found old Tom Hawthorne a tiresome
companion, on their prowl round the stables, and
soon escaped to his aunt's sitting-room; he must somehow
arrange for Katherine to see the pictures with him
after lunch.</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine was reading the <i>Times</i> when he
came in, and looked up delightedly. She enjoyed converse
with her favourite at any hour.</p>

<p>They talked of many things; politics in chief. Her
Ladyship's views were Tory to the backbone, but she
had a speculative cynical lightness which leavened any
retrogressive tendencies. Gerard often disagreed with
her just to draw out her views. She loathed the Radical
government. It aroused her fiercest sarcasms and
contempt.</p>

<p>How could such a class of people, she argued, from
their heredity, no matter what clever brains they had,
have the right qualities in them to enable them to govern
England? How could they with personal and financial
axes to grind possibly concentrate honestly upon the
welfare of the country above their own necessities? It
was quite ridiculous in logic, whether their views were
Radical or Tory. The supreme voice in the government
of a country should only be in the hands of those
raised by their position above all temptation for merely
personal aggrandisement, so that the glory of the country
could be their legitimate and undivided aim. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
could not be that the little Mr. Browns and Greens with
their parochial lawyer instincts and bitter class hatreds,
greedy for their salaries and own advancement, could
rise to the necessary heights of sublime prevision to
enable them to see far enough ahead to have the final
decision on any great question. She was all in favour
of the most advanced views for the advantage and raising
of the lower classes in freedom and education, no
matter from which side they emanated. But she resented
the pushing up of individuals totally unfit in
integrity of character for the positions of authority
they occupied, and who year after year were exposed
as having in some way lowered the standard of honour
in their office.</p>

<p>She would receive none such in her house.</p>

<p>"I eat with no one who lowers the prestige of my
country in the eyes of other nations," she declared.
"Making us a laughing-stock in Europe where we were
once great!"</p>

<p>And for her that settled matters!</p>

<p>Mr. Strobridge coasted warily among the shoals of
her opinions, and gradually got the conversation on
the topic of the pictures in the gallery, some of which
she really thought ought to be sent to London to be
cleaned&mdash;had Gerard noticed lately?&mdash;particularly two
early Italians? This was a most fortunate suggestion!
Mr. Strobridge had noticed&mdash;and had meant to speak
about them.</p>

<p>"We must have a critical examination to-day after
luncheon while the light is good. One ought not to
delay over such matters."</p>

<p>He knew incidently that his aunt was going to drive
Tom Hawthorne into the town in her phaeton, to try
a new pair of cobs which she had bought just before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Christmas, and would be starting the moment that meal
was finished&mdash;but he showed just the right amount of
regret and surprise when she informed him of this fact.</p>

<p>"Never mind. I will go round alone, or better still,
if you could spare Miss Bush for an hour, I will get
her to make shorthand notes of what I think should be
done to each picture."</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine looked at her nephew shrewdly;
his face was innocent as a babe's.</p>

<p>"I believe Miss Bush would make quite an agreeable
companion in a picture gallery," she remarked.</p>

<p>"I am sure you are perfectly right."</p>

<p>Then they both laughed.</p>

<p>"G., you won't flirt with the girl, will you, and turn
her head?"</p>

<p>"The sad part of the affair is that it is the girl who
is more likely to turn my head. Her own is far too
well screwed on."</p>

<p>"Upon my word, I believe you! Well, then, innocent
of thirty-five, don't be beguiled into idiocy by this competent
<i>s&eacute;ductrice</i> of twenty-two!&mdash;If you were forty-five
there would be no hope for you, but a glimmer of
sanity may remain in the thirties!"</p>

<p>"She <i>is</i> attractive, Seraphim&mdash;and will love to see
the pictures. She says she wants to learn about art
and literature&mdash;and kindred things."</p>

<p>"And you have offered to teach her?"</p>

<p>Mr. Strobridge put on a modest air, while his humorous
grey eyes met his aunt's merrily.</p>

<p>"I have applied for the post of tutor&mdash;with no salary
attached."</p>

<p>"She won't put up with inefficiency; you will have to
keep your wits at high-water mark, then."</p>

<p>"I feel that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, G., perhaps you deserve a treat. The Christmas
entertainment I had provided for you in the way
of L&auml;o fell rather flat, did it not!"</p>

<p>"One grows tired of souffl&eacute;."</p>

<p>"Yes, but do not forget that more substantial food
can cause shocking indigestion, unless partaken of with
moderation."</p>

<p>"Heavens, Seraphim! I am no gourmand!"</p>

<p>"Gerard, my dear boy&mdash;you are at a stage of hunger,
I fear, when intelligence may not guide discretion. You
see, Nature is apt to break out after years of artificial
repression."</p>

<p>"We are overcivilised, I admit."</p>

<p>At that moment, the luncheon-gong sounded and they
both rose from their chairs.</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine slipped her fat hand into her
nephew's arm, as they went down the stairs.</p>

<p>"G.&mdash;I leave the afternoon to you&mdash;only don't burn
your fingers irretrievably; this young woman is no fool
like poor L&auml;o. I look upon her as a rather marvellous
product of the twentieth century."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>


<p>After lunch the two in the picture gallery passed
a perfectly delightful half-hour. Mr. Strobridge
had sagacity enough to know that he must stick
loyally to art, and indeed after the first few minutes he
found he was carried away himself, his listener was so
interested, and gave such intelligent response. He almost
began to believe that she had really come there to
learn something; and not to flirt with himself! Her
taste also surprised him, and her want of all pose.</p>

<p>She wrote systematically the reflections he made as
to the condition of the canvases.</p>

<p>"It is a great thing to learn how to look at pictures,"
she said when they halted before a particularly primitive
Madonna. "Of course I could not have seen anything
to admire in this if I had come by myself, and
I do not suppose that I shall ever be able really to
appreciate it&mdash;except the colour&mdash;because there is
something in me which likes the real so much better
than the ideal; I like prose far more than poetry, for
instance."</p>

<p>"Will you let me come up again to the schoolroom
and read to you some day?"</p>

<p>"I should like that very much."</p>

<p>"I would try to make you love poetry; you are endeavouring
to convince me that you are a very material
young woman, you know!"</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I am material. I like facts and
solid things."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"And yet you spoke of dreamland once not so very
long ago&mdash;do you remember!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but you do not know that this dreamland of
mine may not be a place where wished-for facts and
solid things appear realities, not fancies."</p>

<p>"You would not tell me if I asked you; I recollect
how you eluded me before, and said it was a place which
only admitted yourself."</p>

<p>"Even materialists must have some corner where they
can be alone."</p>

<p>Then he questioned her.&mdash;How had she learned all
that she knew?&mdash;And his interest did not diminish when
she gave him a brief outline of the manner of her education.</p>

<p>"It was very difficult sometimes, because I never had
anyone with whom to talk, and one grows one-sided <i>if</i>
one has only oneself to argue with, and I don't really
know how to pronounce numbers of words. I should
be grateful if you would tell me every time I make a
mistake."</p>

<p>"It is quite evident that we must ratify this compact
that I shall be your tutor, though I am to get no wages&mdash;even
love!"</p>

<p>"Who would be supposed to give the love?"</p>

<p>Her strange eyes glanced at him provokingly for a
second, and then resumed their steady look. He was
quite uncertain as to whether in this there lay a challenge.&mdash;He
proceeded to act as if there did.</p>

<p>"When I come up to give my first lesson I will tell
you all about the giving&mdash;and taking&mdash;of love."</p>

<p>"That would be of no advantage to either of us. Love
is a thing which can cause only pain."</p>

<p>"You are quite mistaken&mdash;it is the only divine joy
in this unsatisfactory world."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>Her face changed; she felt this was cruelly true&mdash;and
she did not wish to be reminded of the fact.</p>

<p>"You shall only come to the schoolroom if you talk
sense. I will not listen to a word of speculation about
love; it is pure waste of time&mdash;but in any case I do not
see how you can come there at all. I would not receive
you without Her Ladyship's permission&mdash;it was very
kind of her to let me have this afternoon."</p>

<p>"What a circumspect darling!"</p>

<p>Miss Bush looked at him with scorn.</p>

<p>"I am not a darlings&mdash;I am a lower middle class young
woman, trying to learn how to be a lady, and whatever
you think, if you want to be with me, you will have to
treat me as if I had arrived at my goal already."</p>

<p>"I think you have, but the greatest ladies are often
darlings."</p>

<p>"Yes, but married men do not tell them so, on very
short acquaintance, Mr. Strobridge."</p>

<p>In his case he felt this was rather true, since he never
spoke to girls at all if he could help it. He suddenly
wondered in what light he really did consider her?&mdash;As
an abstract and quite adorably provoking woman, he
supposed.</p>

<p>"Is there anything else to be written down?" she
asked. She had become the conventional secretary.
"Because if not, I must go back to my work."</p>

<p>"My aunt gave me full permission to keep you for
two hours. I told her all we had to do would take quite
that time."</p>

<p>"Well, you see it has not&mdash;we have come to the end
of the gallery."</p>

<p>"Then there is a very comfortable sofa not too far
from the fire, where we could sit down and discuss what
we have learned."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>They walked to it. As long as he was being of some
use to her Katherine Bush desired his company. So
they talked uninterruptedly until dusk fell, and the
footmen would soon be coming to close shutters and
draw curtains.</p>

<p>They flitted from subject to subject, Gerard Strobridge
exerting his brain to interest and amuse her, in
a way that he had seldom done with Englishwomen, even
of his own class. Her receptive power was exceptional,
and she was completely frank. She was honestly and
deeply interested in all he had to say, and the subtle
flattery of this was eminently soothing. He began to
take pride in his pupil. They touched upon the spirit
of the Renaissance and its origin&mdash;and upon all the
glorious flood of light which it brought to art and learning.
He was astonished to find her so advanced in
certain branches of literature, and absolutely ignorant
of the names even of others&mdash;showing that it had merely
been chance and no helping hand which had guided her.</p>

<p>"I must send you some books upon the Renaissance,"
he said, "if you will let me."</p>

<p>"That will be very kind&mdash;If I had had some master
to give me an idea what to read, as a kind of basis to go
upon, it would have been much better, but I had no
guide&mdash;only if I saw one subject that I did not know
about mentioned in what I was reading, I looked it up,
but of course with really educated people there must be
some plan."</p>

<p>"Well, shall we begin upon the Renaissance; that is
rather a favourite period of mine?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;do you not wonder if we shall ever have another?&mdash;What
a lot of good it would do us, would it
not?"</p>

<p>"Probably&mdash;some learned professors think that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
must go through a second series of dark ages first; when
we shall get back to primitive ideas&mdash;and primitive
passions."</p>

<p>"It may be,&mdash;nearly everything natural is distorted
now; the world seems so tired to me, just looking on."</p>

<p>He stretched himself and threw out his arms&mdash;as it
were to break some imaginary bonds.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;we have been coerced into false morals and
manners&mdash;and we have suppressed most things which
make life worth having&mdash;sometimes I envy the beasts."</p>

<p>"I never do that&mdash;it is only weaklings who are
coerced; the strong do what they please, even in these
days&mdash;but however strong a beast may be, he always
finds, as Jack London shows with his wonderful <i>Buck</i>
in 'The Call of the Wild,' that there is invariably 'the
man with the club.'"</p>

<p>"You mean to conquer fate, then?"</p>

<p>"I shall do my very best to obtain my desires, and
of course shall have to pay for all my mistakes."</p>

<p>He looked at her curiously&mdash;had she made any mistakes?
Not many, he thought, her regard was so
serene, and her clever, strong face showed no vacillation.
He suddenly faced the fact that he was falling
in love with her, not as he had tried to do with L&auml;o&mdash;not
even as he had once succeeded in doing with Alice
Southerwood, long ago. There was a quality in his
present feeling which almost frightened him, it was so
lawless.</p>

<p>She felt his eyes searching hers burningly, and rose
from the sofa.</p>

<p>"Now I am going to have my tea&mdash;so good-bye for
to-day. I have really enjoyed the pictures."</p>

<p>"May not I come and have tea with you? I am all
alone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly not&mdash;Martha would be scandalised. It
does seem so extraordinary that I should have to tell
you such things&mdash;it shows either great disrespect to
me, or else&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" eagerly. He had risen, too, and was following
her as she walked down the long room.</p>

<p>"&mdash;That you cannot help yourself."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that is it. You have bewitched me in some
way&mdash;I cannot help myself."</p>

<p>"Do you want all I have taken down typewritten? I
can do it after tea, if so?"</p>

<p>"And you will sit up there all by yourself from now
until you go to bed?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"You must feel awfully solitary."</p>

<p>"Not in the least. I have books which are the most
agreeable companions. They have no independent moods&mdash;you
can be sure of them, and pick up those which
suit yourself. Good-night."</p>

<p>And she turned at the bend of the great staircase
from which the gallery opened, and rapidly walked on
to the entrance to her passage.</p>

<p>He looked after her with a rapt face, and then he
went discontentedly down into the library, and waited
for his aunt's return.</p>

<p>He was extremely disturbed; it was horribly tantalizing
to feel that this girl whom he was so passionately
drawn to, was there in the house with him, and that he
might not talk with her further, or be in her presence.</p>

<p>He walked up and down the room&mdash;and those who
knew the casual Gerard Strobridge, cultivated, polished
and self-contained, would have been greatly surprised
could they have seen his agitated pacings.</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine had a quizzical eye when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
finally came in&mdash;how had the afternoon progressed? Her
opinion of the mental balance of her secretary was exceedingly
high. She felt convinced that she would know
exactly how to tackle her nephew, and if Gerard desired
to amuse himself he would certainly do so whether she
smiled upon the affair or not!</p>

<p>It did strike her that he was rather a dangerous
creature to be left a free hand with any young woman&mdash;and
that after to-day she would see that Katherine
ran no more risks from too much of his company.</p>

<p>The pupils of his eyes were rather dilated, she
noticed; otherwise he seemed his usual self at tea&mdash;and
when Colonel Hawthorne left them alone, she got him
to read to her, and did not mention her secretary at all.</p>

<p>The afternoon had been most instructive, Katherine
thought, as she ate her muffin, and looked at the papers
before the old schoolroom fire. She had learned a quantity
of things. Mr. Strobridge was undoubtedly a
charming man, and she wondered what effect he would
have had upon her if she had never met Algy? As it
was he mattered no more than a chair or a table, he
was just part of her game. And he was rapidly approaching
the state when she could obtain complete
dominion over him.</p>

<p>"He knows quite well that he is married and that I
can never honestly be anything to him. He is only
coming after me because he is attracted and is not
master of his passions or his will. If he is a weakling
he must pay the price&mdash;I shall not care! He is not
thinking in the least as to whether or no it will hurt
me&mdash;he is only thinking of himself, just like Bob Hartley,
only he is a gentleman and therefore does not make
any hypocritical promises to try to lure me."</p>

<p>And then she laughed softly. "Well, whatever comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
is on his own head, I need have no mercy upon him!"</p>

<p>So she calmly finished her tea and wrote to Matilda
whose excited letter with the family news of Gladys'
secret marriage she had not yet replied to. Gladys
had written her a little missive also&mdash;full of thanks for
her part in the affair. Bob was being rather rude and
unkind to her about it, she said, but it was not altogether
his fault, because on Christmas night he had
had rather too much to drink, and had been quarrelsome
for two days since. She was going to keep the
expected event from being known as long as possible,
and then she supposed they would go and live somewhere
together. It would be wretched poverty and
struggle, and she was miserable, but at least she felt an
"honest woman," and could not be grateful enough to
her sister for bringing this state of things about. Katherine
stared into the fire while she thought over it all.
It seemed to her too astonishing that a woman should
prefer a life tied to a man who was reluctant to keep
her&mdash;his drudge and the object of his scorn&mdash;to one of
her own arranging in America, perhaps&mdash;along with
the child, but free. Gladys had sufficient talent in her
trade to have earned good wages anywhere, and must
have enough money saved, could she have got it from
Matilda's fond guardian clutches, to have tided over
the time. But weaklings must always suffer and be
other people's slaves and tools. Poor Gladys! Then
she fell to thinking of Algy&mdash;why was he haunting her?
For the first month the complacent satisfaction from
the conquest of self had upheld her splendidly, but now
the pain felt as keen as on the first day of separation.</p>

<p><i>She would crush it.</i></p>

<p>Except on the path coming out of church she had no
words with Mr. Strobridge on the morrow&mdash;and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
it was only a few sentences of ordinary greeting. Lady
Garribardine claimed his entire attention. She did see
him from the window, smoking a cigar in the rose garden
in the afternoon, whither he had come from the
smoking-room. She deliberately let him catch sight of
her, as she stood there, and she marked the look of
eager joy on his face, and then she moved away and did
not appear again.</p>

<p>So the Monday arrived&mdash;the last day of the old year.</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine was having no party for it as
was her usual custom; her rheumatism was rather
troublesome, and she stayed in the house all the day, up
in her boudoir, where Katherine was in constant attendance.</p>

<p>Gerard and Colonel Hawthorne were out rabbiting
with the keepers in the park, and only came in to tea.</p>

<p>Katherine found her mistress rather exacting and
difficult to please, and she felt tired and cross&mdash;so it
gave her some kind of satisfaction to be as provoking
as possible when she was ordered to pour out the tea
for the shooters in the sitting-room. She remained perfectly
silent, but every now and then allowed her magnetic
eyes to meet Mr. Strobridge's with the sphinxlike
smile in them.</p>

<p>On his side Gerard had found the hours hell.&mdash;He
knew he was now madly in love with this exasperating
girl, and that she was exercising the most powerful attraction
upon him.</p>

<p>He gazed at her as she sat there, white and sensuous-looking,
her red lips pouting, and her grey-green eyes
full of some unconscious challenge, and gradually wild
excitement grew in his blood.</p>

<p>As soon as her actual duties were over, Katherine
said respectfully:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"If Your Ladyship has no more need of me, I must
get some letters finished before the post goes."</p>

<p>And when a nod of assent was given, she quietly left
the room.</p>

<p>So Gerard Strobridge knew he would see her no more
that night; and there would be a boring dinner with
the parson, and his wife and daughter, to be got
through, and on the morrow he was returning to town!</p>

<p>For the first time in their lives he felt resentful
towards his aunt. That Seraphim should not have been
more sympathetic, and have made some opportunity for
him to talk again to Katherine, was quite too bad!</p>

<p>She, who usually understood all his moods and wants!
Her silence upon the subject of her secretary, ever since
her return from that drive, was ominous, now that he
thought about it. Evidently he need hope for no further
co&ouml;peration from her, and because he was feeling
so deeply, he could not act in the casual and intelligent
way to secure his ends which he would have used on
other occasions. So the incredibly wearisome evening
passed. The guests left early, and Lady Garribardine
went gladly to bed, leaving her nephew and Colonel
Hawthorne to drink in the New Year together&mdash;the
New Year of 1912.</p>

<p>But the old gentleman was fatigued with his day's
shooting and when half-past eleven came he was glad
to slink off to his friendly couch.</p>

<p>Thus Gerard was alone.</p>

<p>He lit a cigar and stretched himself in a huge leather
armchair, an untouched drink close at hand.</p>

<p>The house was quite silent. He had told Bronson
that he would put out the lights in the smoking-room
when they left. No one was about and not a breath
of wind stirred a tree outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>He sat there for some minutes&mdash;and then his heart
began to beat violently.</p>

<p>Whose was that soft footfall directly overhead?
With the departure of the grandchildren from the old
nurseries there was no one left in the wing but Katherine
Bush!</p>

<p>All sorts of visions came to him; she had not yet
gone to bed&mdash;perhaps she, too, was waiting for the New
Year?</p>

<p>He got up and listened, his pulses bounding so that
he seemed to hear his heart thumping against his side.</p>

<p>There was the sound again!</p>

<p>It was not to be endured. Fierce emotion shook him,
and at last all restraint fell from him, and passion became
lord.</p>

<p>Then he extinguished the lights and softly crept up
the stairs.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>


<p>Katherine had that instant removed her
dressing-gown after the brushing of her hair,
which now hung in two long plaits. She was in
the act of slipping into bed. The carpet in the passage
was thick, and she heard no sounds, so that the first
thing which startled her was the actual opening of the
door of her room, which it had not been her custom to
lock.</p>

<p>For one second a blind terror shook her, and then all
her nerve and resource returned. She stood there
magnificent in her anger and resentment. She had no
female instinct instantly to seize the dressing-gown to
cover herself. She stood straight up in her cheap nainsook
nightgown, all the beautiful lines of her tall, slender
figure showing in the soft shaded light.</p>

<p>Gerard Strobridge was like a man drunk with wine.
His eye flamed and he trembled with excitement. The
bed, a small old wooden one, was between them with a
writing-table at the foot. So that to reach her he must
go round by the fire.</p>

<p>This he did, while he whispered hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Katherine&mdash;I love you&mdash;madly&mdash;I had to come to
you, darling girl!" Then he stopped within a few feet
of her, literally sobered by the expression of her face.
It showed not an atom of fear&mdash;rather the proud contempt
of an empress ordering the death of a presuming
slave.</p>

<p>She did not speak for a moment; she seemed to draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
up to her full height, and even to grow taller; she was
only an inch or two less than himself. And if the scorn
of eyes could kill, he would have lain there dead.</p>

<p>"Darling!" he cried, and went forward to take her
in his arms.</p>

<p>She stepped back only one step and spoke at last,
her deep tones low.</p>

<p>"If you dare to touch me, I will kill you&mdash;I am not
afraid of you, you know&mdash;You are only a beast, after
all&mdash;and I am the man with the club."</p>

<p>"Beautiful fiend!"&mdash;but he hesitated&mdash;He was no
coward, and cared not a jot for her threats, only his
fastidiousness was assailed by the thought of a struggling,
fighting woman in his embrace, when he had come
there for&mdash;Love! It would be wiser, perhaps, to cajole
her. He was too intoxicated with passion to realise
that it would also seem more dignified!</p>

<p>"Katherine, do not be so horribly unkind, darling
girl! I love you wildly, I tell you, and I want you to
be mine."</p>

<p>"What for?" She was perfectly calm still, and never
moved from her place.</p>

<p>"That we may be happy, you sweet thing. I want
to hold you in my arms and caress you, and make us
both forget that there is anything else in the whole wide
world but our own two selves!"</p>

<p>And exalted by this enchanting picture, he drew a
little closer and held out his hands.</p>

<p>"I tell you plainly&mdash;if you come one step nearer to
me, you do so at your own risk. I will tear the flesh
from your face with my nails, and strangle you." Her
voice was absolutely deadly in its icy intentness. "I
am not weak, and I despise your mean action in coming
here to-night too greatly to have any fear."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>The breeding in him responded to this sting.</p>

<p>"My mean action&mdash;!" but his voice faltered a little,
and she interrupted him before he could argue further.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I am a dependent in your aunt's house here,
earning my living, and you chance my being disgraced
and sent away for your own shamefully selfish ends. Indeed,
you are teaching me the lesson of the depth to
which an aristocrat can sink."</p>

<p>He drew back, and some of the fire died out of him.
Her words cut him like a knife, but he was too overwrought
with emotion yet to give in and leave her.</p>

<p>"Katherine&mdash;my darlings&mdash;forgive me!" he cried,
brokenly. "I admit I am mad with love, but you shall
never suffer for it&mdash;give yourself to me, and I will take
you away from all drudgery. You shall have a house
where you like. I will protect you and teach you all
you desire to know. You shall lead an intellectual life
worthy of your brain. We can travel in Italy and
France, and I shall worship and adore you&mdash;Katherine,
my sweet!"</p>

<p>The tones of his cultivated voice vibrated with deep
feeling, and he looked all that was attractive as he stood
there in his faultless evening clothes, pleading to her
as though he were but a humble suppliant for grace,
and she a queen.</p>

<p>But Katherine was not in the least touched, although
her awakened critical faculties realised fully the agreeable
companion he would probably make as a lover, with
his knowledge of the world, and his polished homage
to women. There was something fierce and savagely
primitive at this moment in her faithfulness to Algy.
For all the strongly sensuous side of her nature, any
other man's caresses appeared revolting to her. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
<i>the man</i>, not <i>men</i>, who could arouse her passionate
sensibility.</p>

<p>"You ask me to be your mistress, then&mdash;is that it?"
her voice was coldly level, like one discussing a business
proposition.</p>

<p>His whole face lit up again&mdash;there was hope perhaps
after all.</p>

<p>"Of course, darling&mdash;What else?"</p>

<p>"It is an insult&mdash;but I am not concerned with that
point. My views are perhaps not orthodox. I am
merely interested in my side of the affair, which is that
I have not the slightest wish for the post. I will be
no man's mistress&mdash;do you hear?"</p>

<p>"Katherine, can I not make you love me, sweet?"</p>

<p>She laughed softly. It was a dangerous sound, ominous
as that which a lioness might make when she purrs.</p>

<p>"Not if you stayed on your knees for a thousand
years! I have loved one man in my life with the kind
of love which you desire&mdash;I know exactly what it means,
and probably I shall never love another in that way&mdash;I
sacrificed him for my idea. I had will enough to leave
him, feeling for him what perhaps you feel for me. So
do you think, then, that you could move me in the least!&mdash;You
whom I do not love, but&mdash;despise!"</p>

<p>All this time, she stood there utterly desirable in her
thin raiment, which she had never sought to cover. Indeed,
now that she saw that she was going to win the
game, she took joy that he should understand what
he had lost, so that his punishment should be the more
complete: there was nothing pitiful or tender about
Katherine Bush. Her strange, strong character had
no mercy for a man who had shown her that he was not
master of himself&mdash;above all things, she admired self-control.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>Gerard Strobridge suffered, as she spoke, as perhaps
he had never done in his life before. If he had been one
whit less of a gentleman, he would not now have conquered
himself; he would have seized her in his arms,
and made her pay for her scalding words. The effect
of tradition for centuries, however, held him even beyond
the mad longing which again thrilled through his
blood as he looked at her.</p>

<p>He flung himself into the armchair and buried his
head in his hands.</p>

<p>"My God!" he cried, hoarsely, "how you can torture&mdash;can
you not? I knew when I watched you in church
that you could be cruel as the grave&mdash;but I thought to-day
when you looked at me there in my aunt's sitting-room,
that to me perhaps you meant to be kind; your
face is the essence of passion&mdash;it would deceive any
man."</p>

<p>"Then it is well that you should be undeceived&mdash;and
that we should understand one another. What did you
think you would gain by coming here to-night?&mdash;My
seduction? And some pleasure for yourself." She was
horribly scornful again. "You never thought of me&mdash;It
does not matter what my personal views are about
such relations; you do not know them, and I do not
believe that I have given you reason to think that you
might treat me with want of respect; but your action
shows that you do not respect me, I can only presume,
because of my dependent position, and because you
despise my class&mdash;since you would certainly not have
behaved so to any of your aunt's guests."</p>

<p>He writhed a little at her taunt, and his face was
haggard now as he looked up at her.</p>

<p>"There is no use in my asking you to forgive me&mdash;but
it is not true that I do not respect you, or that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
have acted as I have for the reason that I despise your
class&mdash;That is a hateful thought. I came here to-night
because I am a man&mdash;and was simply mad with longing
for you after the tantalization of the last two days,
and never being able to speak a word to you." His
breath came rather fast, and he locked together his
hands. "I love you&mdash;I would have come had you been
the highest lady in the land. My action was not premeditated&mdash;it
was yielding to a sudden strong temptation
because I was sitting there in the smoking-room
thinking of you, and I heard the noise of your soft
footfall overhead, and suddenly all the furious passion
in me would no longer be denied and cried out for you!"</p>

<p>He rose and came over to her, and sitting down on
the edge of the bed, he held out his arms to her in supplication.
"It swept away all the civilisation in me.
Nature breaks asunder all barriers in the best of us at
times&mdash;and you are so adorably dear&mdash;Katherine&mdash;darling&mdash;I
have done this thing, and now it is too late
for me to plead for your pardon&mdash;but I love you more
wildly than I have ever loved a woman in my life.&mdash;You
could make me your slave, Katherine, if you would only
give yourself to me. I would chase away the memory
of that other and teach you all the divine things of love
there are to learn in life."</p>

<p>She moved and stood by the fireplace. She was shivering
a little, half from cold.</p>

<p>"I forbid you to say another word on this subject,"
she said gravely, but with less of her former scorn.
"Neither you nor any other man could rob me of the
memory of my once dear lover&mdash;but I would rather not
hate you&mdash;so I appeal to that part of you that I still
think is a gentleman to go at once out of my room."</p>

<p>He followed her to the fire almost overcome again by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the picture she presented in her straight thin garment,
virgin white and plain. He wildly desired to unplait
that thick soft hair and bury his face in it&mdash;he longed
to hold her to his heart. But he restrained himself.</p>

<p>There was complete silence for a second or two, and
then across the park in the church tower, midnight
pealed, tolling the dying year.</p>

<p>They both lifted their heads to listen, unconsciously
counting the strokes, and then when the last one struck,
and the joyous bells rang out, something in their sound
melted the anger and contempt in Katherine's soul. She
looked at him, his refined, distinguished face very pale
and utterly dejected now. And the broad-minded, level-headed
judgment which she brought to bear on all matters
told her that she had no right to great anger and
made her realise for the first time that she was actually
to blame perhaps for this situation having developed
since she had not sufficiently considered what might be
the possible result of arresting a man's attention
through the eyes and ears.</p>

<p>"Listen," she said gently, holding out her beautiful
hand. "Here is the New Year&mdash;I do not want to begin
it with any hard thoughts&mdash;After all, I understand you&mdash;and
I forgive you. I believe I have been in some
measure to blame. I cannot ever be your love&mdash;but I
am very lonely&mdash;won't you be my true knight and
friend?"</p>

<p>She had touched the deepest chord of his being. The
tears sprang to his fine grey eyes; he knelt down upon
the rug and bent and kissed her knees.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I will&mdash;I swear it, darling&mdash;And whatever
suffering it brings to me, I will never make you regret
your sweet forgiveness of me, and your resumed trust in
me to-night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>She leaned forward, and for an instant smoothed his
thick brown hair in blessing.</p>

<p>He took her hands and kissed the palms, and then
without another word, he rose and went towards the
door. There he turned and looked at her, standing in
the firelight, the dark oak-panelled room only lit by the
one small electric-shaded lamp by the bed. He looked
and looked, as though his famished eyes must surfeit
themselves with the vision. It was fair enough to see!</p>

<p>And then he noiselessly quitted the room and went
on down the stairs to the smoking-room as silently as
he had come.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>


<p>The months went by. It was Easter time before
Katherine Bush again saw Gerard Strobridge.
He went off to Egypt about the middle of January,
and Lady Garribardine was up in London for a
few days alone before he left seeing her grandchildren
off. Katherine missed him, and unconsciously his influence
directed her studies. She remembered isolated sentences
that he had used in their talk that day in the
picture gallery. He had certainly shown a delightfully
cultivated mind, and she wished that things had not
reached a climax so soon between them. She regretted
deeply that she had caused him any pain and determined
never to deviate from loyal friendship so that he
should have no cause to suffer further. He had not forgotten
about the books, and she was now the proud
possessor of several volumes on the Renaissance, including,
of course, Symonds and Pater. They opened
yet another door in her imagination, and on days when
she was not very busy, she would wander in the picture
gallery and go over all the examples of the Italian
masters again and again, and try to get the atmosphere
of the books.</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine watched her silently for the first
few weeks after her nephew went, without increasing
their intimacy. Her shrewd mind was studying Katherine,
to make sure that she had made no mistake about
her. Such a very deep creature might have sides which
would make her regret having dropped the reserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
which, accompanied by a high-handed kindliness, she
showed to all her dependents.</p>

<p>The great event of New Year's day had been the advent
of the grey wig so beautifully arranged with her
ladyship's own snow-white hair, that the whole thing
seemed growing together! With her dark, sparkling
eyes and jet brows, she now looked an extremely handsome
old lady; and Katherine who did not see her until
the afternoon when they were alone, was unable to keep
a faint, almost inaudible "Ah!" of admiration from escaping,
when she first saw her. She was furious with
herself and bit her lip, but Lady Garribardine smiled.</p>

<p>"You would say something, Miss Bush? Pray
speak."</p>

<p>Katherine coloured a little; she felt this was one of
those slips which she very seldom made, but frankness
being always her method, she answered quietly:</p>

<p>"I only thought how beautiful Your Ladyship looked&mdash;just
like the Nattier in the gallery."</p>

<p>"You find my grey locks an improvement, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!"</p>

<p>"The Nattier was an ancestress of mine.&mdash;A French
entanglement of a great great-grandfather, which
ended, as these affairs are seldom fortunate enough to
do, in a marriage all correct with the church's blessing&mdash;the
husband being most conveniently killed in a duel
with another man!&mdash;So the then d'Estaire brought her
here to Blissington, where she was shockingly bored,
poor thing! and died a year or two after producing an
heir for him. When I was young, I always went to
fancy balls as the charming creature&mdash;it is amusing
that you see the likeness even now."</p>

<p>"It is very striking."</p>

<p>"I always felt a great pity for her&mdash;transplanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
from Versailles and all the joys of the Court, to this
quiet, English home&mdash;Have you ever read Lord Chesterfield's
letters to his son, girl?"</p>

<p>Katherine had not.</p>

<p>"Well, then, you had better read them; there is a
good edition in the library. They are, you will find,
the most instructive things in English literature. If I
had had a son, I would have brought him up upon them.
I was reminded of them now by thinking of my twice
great-grandmother. Chesterfield always quotes the
French nobles of that date as the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of good
breeding, and rather suggests that the Englishmen were
often boors or blockheads. So although d'Estaire may
have satisfied her, the general company could not have
done so, one feels."</p>

<p>"I would like to see Versailles," Katherine ventured
to remark.</p>

<p>"You will some day&mdash;I may go to Paris after Easter&mdash;one
must have clothes."</p>

<p>Katherine realised this necessity&mdash;her own wardrobe
would require replenishing by the springtime, but she
had not dreamed of Paris.</p>

<p>Her immediate action after this was to get from the
library the Chesterfield Letters, the reading of which
she always afterwards looked back upon as being the
second milestone in her career. She devoured them,
and learned countless advantageous lessons of the world
therefrom. The first and chief being the value of graciousness
and good manners. She now began to realise
that her own were too sullen and abrupt, and a marked
change in them was soon perceivable to anyone who
would have cared to notice. This was during the time
when she was still only on probation in her employer's
favour, but it was not lost upon that astute lady;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
nothing ever escaped her eagle eye. And she often
smiled to herself quietly when she watched the girl.</p>

<p>Now and then they would go up to the London house
for a few days and "picnic," as Her Ladyship called it,
which meant taking only her personal footman to wait
on her, and a maid or two for the house. Katherine
went with her nearly always, and was sent shopping and
allowed to go and see her family, if she wished.</p>

<p>But she did not wish, and always met Matilda at
some place for tea. The gulf between them was growing
wider and wider, and while Katherine was far more
agreeable than of old, Matilda stood in much greater
awe of her.</p>

<p>She felt, although she would not have owned it for
the world, that her sister had really gone into another
class, and she was not quite comfortable with her.
Katherine seemed to look more stately and refined each
time, and Matilda gloried and grieved in secret over it.</p>

<p>Gladys accompanied her on one occasion.</p>

<p>"I suppose Kitten will be marrying one of them
gentlemen, some day," Matilda said on the way home
to Laburnum Villa. "You'd never know she wasn't
someone tip-top now, would you, Glad?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;she is quite like any of our 'real thing' lot who
came into Ermantine's&mdash;they're dowdy, but you'd know
they were it."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope she'll be happy." Matilda sighed
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, she will," Gladys returned a little bitterly.
"Katherine would never do anything to get herself into
a mess; she is quite just, and she can be awfully kind&mdash;but
she looks to the end of things and doesn't care a
rush for anyone but sticks to what she wants herself. I
tell you what, Tild, I used to hate her&mdash;but I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
now&mdash;I respect Katherine. She is so perfectly true."</p>

<p>"She seems to talk different, don't you notice, Glad?"</p>

<p>"She always did&mdash;but now more than ever; she is
like our best lot&mdash;I suppose she did learn something
extra at those evening classes she was so fond of?"</p>

<p>Matilda shook her head regretfully.</p>

<p>"I never did hold to them&mdash;she'd have been happy at
home now and engaged to Charlie Prodgers all comfortable,
but for that nonsense."</p>

<p>"Oh! but, Tild, I expect what she has got is better
even than that."</p>

<p>"What! to be a grand lady's servant, Glad! My!
I'd far rather be Mrs. Prodgers, junior, a lady myself,
and keep my own general! Mabel's forever saying
Katherine can't be anything but a slave&mdash;And Mabel
knows&mdash;her cousin's aunt's daughter who married that
gentleman with the large city business was presented
at Court!"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Bob Hartley only sighed. Life was growing
particularly grim for her just now. She felt horribly
ill, and had to stand about all day, and conceal
every sensation to keep up the appearances that all was
fair.</p>

<p>Katherine reflected deeply upon the moral of the
situation, after her sisters had left her. What martyrs
many women were in life! and what hideous injustice it
all seemed&mdash;and more than ever she saw how merciless
nature is to weaklings.</p>

<p>About three weeks before Easter, Lady Garribardine
was alone down at Blissington; she had lately taken to
having her secretary with her sometimes on her frequent
visits to her cottagers.</p>

<p>She would start in a rough, short suit, and a pair of
thick boots, with a serviceable walking-stick, and would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
tramp for miles carrying a basket, in which were sweets
and medicines. She was worshipped by her people, arrogant,
commanding, kindly great lady!</p>

<p>On one of these occasions they had the motor to meet
them at the end of the home village, and drove six or
seven miles to another in her outlying property.</p>

<p>She was very gracious as they went along.</p>

<p>"What books have you been reading lately, girl? If
they are the Chesterfield Letters I think I may tell you
that you have profited by them. Your manners generally
are greatly improved."</p>

<p>Katherine reddened with pleasure.</p>

<p>"I have read them over and over again. I have found
them more instructive to me than any other book."</p>

<p>"In my young days they were considered highly immoral
and pernicious, by most of the canting Victorian
hypocrites&mdash;when, of course, everyone of the world
knew that Chesterfield's advice on all points was the
most sensible and sagacious that could be given&mdash;but
hypocrisy had risen to a colossal height in the sixties
and seventies."</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"Nowadays not one person in ten thousand reads
them, more's the pity. If the young men with their
great personal beauty&mdash;which sport and suitable feeding
have produced&mdash;could have been brought up to understand
the advantage of cultivating 'the graces,' what
godlike creatures they would be!"</p>

<p>Katherine thought of Lord Algy; he must have done
so unconsciously, she felt.</p>

<p>"People are so apt to judge such a book upon the
letter, not the spirit&mdash;naturally one must make allowances
for the different customs and habits of the times;
but the spirit of the advice adapted to modern requirements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
would make any man or woman into an eminent
person if it was faithfully followed. I recommend it to
you strongly, since I believe you are steadily trying to
educate yourself, Miss Bush."</p>

<p>"I am, indeed&mdash;I hope I am not overconfident in believing
that if one probes the meaning of everything,
and can see the faults in oneself, including those of instinct,
it is possible to do, by will, what only the evolution
of centuries accomplishes by natural process. The
Chesterfield Letters have encouraged me in my belief."</p>

<p>"Of course, it is possible, but people will hardly ever
face the truth, and would not dream of examining their
own instincts; it would wound their self-love; they
would rather be mediocre and blinded to their stupidities,
than teach themselves any useful lesson. Your determined
effort interests me deeply, child."</p>

<p>Katherine turned a radiant face of gratitude; this
was praise indeed!</p>

<p>"I will do all I can to merit Your Ladyship's goodness
to me."</p>

<p>"No, I am not good&mdash;I have no altruistic or humanitarian
proclivities&mdash;I would not bother with you for
five minutes if you were not so intelligent that I have
grown to take a kind of pride in you."</p>

<p>"I can't say how I appreciate Your Ladyship's kindness."</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine turned and looked at her for a
second, and then she said slowly:</p>

<p>"I am going to ask you a question not strictly justifiable&mdash;and
you need not answer it if you would rather
not&mdash;but you may have formed some opinion of my integrity
in these months, which will perhaps allow you
to be frank with me&mdash;Did my nephew, Gerard Strobridge,
make violent love to you when he spent Chris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>tmas
with us? It seemed to me at the time, and afterwards,
that he grew considerably depressed."</p>

<p>Katherine felt a twinge of distress.</p>

<p>"Mr. Strobridge showed some interest in me which
I felt it wiser to discourage&mdash;He was very kind to me
though, and agreed to be my friend, and sent me some
books."</p>

<p>For a second, Lady Garribardine felt irritated. Her
precious Gerard to have been a suppliant to this dependent
in her house!&mdash;And then the broad justice of
her nature regained its mastery; the girl was worthy
of the homage of a king.</p>

<p>"I think he must have been extremely hard hit&mdash;I am
quite devoted to him, as you know. I rely upon you
not to hurt him more than you can help, when he comes
back."</p>

<p>"I never wished to hurt him at all&mdash;I did wish to talk
to him, though, because he is so clever, so at first I was
glad to attract his attention. I know now that that was
wrong."</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine looked at her secretary critically.
She was astonished at this frank avowal which she realised
not another woman in a million in Katherine's situation
would have made.</p>

<p>"You deliberately attracted him then, girl, eh?&mdash;&mdash;"
her voice was stern.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;on the afternoon he first spoke to me when we
typed the charity papers. I was so anxious to learn
about books and art, and before that he had not noticed
me at all."</p>

<p>"You did not calculate that it might hurt him?"</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine wondered at herself that she did
not feel angry.</p>

<p>"No. I never thought about that&mdash;he seemed older<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
and of the world, and able to take care of himself, and
he was married."</p>

<p>"None of which things ever saved a man when Eve
offered the apple&mdash;I suppose I ought to be very annoyed
with you, child&mdash;but I believe it has done him
good; he wanted rousing, he is, as you say, so clever.</p>

<p>"He could have done brilliantly, but he is lacking in
perseverance&mdash;If he had married a woman like you, he
would have risen to great things. The finest gift of
God is an indomitable purpose <i>to do</i>. My nephew
drifted, I fear."</p>

<p>Then their talk branched off to other things, and this
proud old aristocrat, having made up her mind now
once for all that Katherine possessed a character and
qualities after her own heart, she from this day treated
her as an equal and a valued companion whenever they
were not in actual relation of employer and secretary;
when in that, she would always resume her original aloof
manner of one in command.</p>

<p>Katherine delighted in this <i>nuance</i>, and appreciated
the subtle tribute to her own sense of the fitness of
things, and never once took the ell when she was given
the inch, showing in this the immeasurable distance she
had risen above her class.</p>

<p>And so Easter came, and with it a large party&mdash;and
Gerard Strobridge. At first sight, he did not appear
at all changed. Katherine saw him from the window of
the schoolroom just at sunset on the Thursday afternoon,
when the guests arrived. He was walking in the
rose garden with a tall, beautiful woman. The lowering
globe of fire was making a blaze of reflected light from
striking the row of mullioned windows of the picture
gallery on the opposite side, and the flower-beds were
a mass of daffodils and hyacinths. It was a nice back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>ground.
He looked up, so Katherine saw his face
plainly&mdash;then she stepped behind the curtain and the
pair went on.</p>

<p>She felt very glad to see him, and wondered when
they would meet. At these huge parties she never came
down, even to pour out the tea if Her Ladyship's hand
ached, as at the smaller family Christmas one. So unless
he made the chance deliberately, it was quite possible
no words would be exchanged.</p>

<p>This uncertainty added to the interest, and made
her decide when Sunday should come to take especial
pains with her appearance for church&mdash;Under Gladys'
direction, she would be most simply and charmingly
garbed, in a new blue serge suit, and becoming black
hat. Before Saturday when they actually met, however,
she had seen Gerard twice, once from the gallery
as she was leaving Lady Garribardine's sitting-room,
and he was talking to the same beautiful lady in the
hall&mdash;and once from her window when he paced the rose
garden alone.</p>

<p>Katherine was familiar with the names and characteristics
of all the guests, for had she not written their
invitations and read their answers? Did she not type
the cards which slipped into the little plates on their
doors, and those for their places at dinner?&mdash;And on
Saturday night a message came for her that she was to
print two more, and go immediately to Bronson with
a fresh arrangement of the table, as two extra men
were going to turn up by motor at the last moment,
guardsmen quartered at Windsor.</p>

<p>She was coming from the dining-room down the passage
which led to her staircase, and also the smoking-room,
when Gerard emerged from there, and met
her at the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>He put out his hand with cordial friendliness, while
he cried gaily:</p>

<p>"At last I can greet you!&mdash;I would not go to dress
on purpose, because I saw you rush down the passage,
and I knew you would have to come back&mdash;It is good
to see you again!"</p>

<p>She answered suitably and would have passed on,
only he barred the way.</p>

<p>"I thought you were going to let me be a friend," he
said reproachfully, "and here you snub me at once and
want to run away."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but you will be late."</p>

<p>"I care not a jot!&mdash;When can I possibly see you to-morrow?"</p>

<p>His eyes began to grow hungry; he was taking in
the subtle improvement in her&mdash;which had happened
even in these few months. His interest in her had not
diminished, he discovered, much as he had hoped that
he had crushed it to within bounds.</p>

<p>"I cannot say&mdash;in church, I suppose."</p>

<p>"That is small comfort! May I not come up the
stairs just for half an hour before lunch?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you find it possible&mdash;remember, I trust you
not to do anything unwise."</p>

<p>"I promise&mdash;if you prefer it, I will ask my aunt's
permission."</p>

<p>"Do as you think best&mdash;but now I must go. Good-night!"</p>

<p>He took her hand and kissed it&mdash;his lips were burning.
Then he watched her as she went up the stairs,
never looking back. And a sudden anguish came over
him. How hopeless the whole thing was! He had better
not have relied upon his self-command, and have
stayed away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not go to church on the Sunday. Katherine
rather wondered at this, as she walked back alone
across the park. In the country, Lady Garribardine
expected the inmates of her house to be very orthodox.</p>

<p>The fine spring wind had blown two faint pink roses
into her cheeks, by the time she reached the schoolroom,
and there found Mr. Strobridge seated in her favourite
armchair reading a book!</p>

<p>He rose eagerly as she entered, but he did not shake
hands.</p>

<p>"I thought possession would be nine points of the
law, so I ensconced myself here, and awaited you, and
I am going to stay until you turn me out."</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;that will be at ten minutes to one&mdash;at
five minutes to, Thomas comes to lay the table for my
lunch."</p>

<p>"That gives us just under half an hour&mdash;Katherine,
you beautiful thing, let me look at you!"</p>

<p>And now he took both her hands and pulled her to
the light.</p>

<p>"You have grown much prettier, you know&mdash;and are
more attractive than ever, alas!"</p>

<p>"If you are going to talk like that, although you may
stay, I shall leave you alone."</p>

<p>"No, I am going to be reasonable. Tell me everything,
what you have been doing, and reading, and
thinking, since I went away?"</p>

<p>"I have been doing my work&mdash;and reading all the
books you gave me&mdash;and many others&mdash;and thinking
about life."</p>

<p>"Never once of me, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;you are part of my life&mdash;my one friend."</p>

<p>He started forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>"Darl&mdash;&mdash;" but he checked himself before the word
came quite out, and said instead:</p>

<p>"Ah! that is joy to hear! And now I want to know
what you thought of Symonds and Pater and the rest?&mdash;You
will have quantities of things to discuss with me,
I am sure."</p>

<p>Katherine began taking off her hat and coat, and
then put them neatly on the long, hard sofa; she never
glanced in the glass or patted her hair&mdash;She was boyish
in her unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Gerard Strobridge watched her, and then suddenly
looked away; the insane desire was rising in him again
to take her in his arms. So he exerted extra control
over himself, and spent the rest of the time in truly
friendly converse, in which he assumed the character of
stern tutor, examining a promising pupil upon a holiday
task performed in his absence.</p>

<p>Katherine was enchanted, and when ten minutes to
one came, she wished he had not to go.</p>

<p>"It has given me so much pleasure to talk to you&mdash;I
am so glad you have come back." But she held her
hands behind her when he would have taken them again,
in gladness at her words.</p>

<p>"So much touching is undesirable if we are going to
remain friends," she told him.</p>

<p>"When may I come again?"</p>

<p>"You must arrange that."</p>

<p>"After tea, just until it is getting dark enough for
Martha to be coming to draw the curtains?"</p>

<p>"Yes, perhaps."</p>

<p>And with this he left comforted.</p>

<p>But when he had gone, Katherine Bush went and
looked out of the window, and very slowly shook her
head in perplexity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>"It will certainly hurt him&mdash;and what will Her
Ladyship say? She may think I am not playing the
game."</p>

<p>And then she remembered Lord Chesterfield's advice
in one of his maxims:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When a man of sense happens to be in that disagreeable
situation in which he is obliged to ask himself more than
once, "What shall I do?"&mdash;he will answer himself&mdash;"Nothing."
When his reason points out to him no good way, or
at least no one way less bad than another, he will stop
short and wait for light.</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>


<p>Katherine Bush always looked back upon
that Easter party as being the third milestone
in her career.</p>

<p>It happened that a certain guest wished to try some
new songs she was going to sing on Sunday night, and
instead of the agreeable gloaming Gerard Strobridge
had been looking forward to enjoying with Katherine
alone, he was forced by his aunt to take this lady up
to the schoolroom after tea and request Miss Bush's
services as accompanist.</p>

<p>Katherine had been practising her old gift of reading
music almost every evening when alone and was
now very proficient. Lady Garribardine knew this, because
she had sent for her secretary to play to her several
times in her sitting-room when she was there without
visitors and was suffering from rheumatism.</p>

<p>Mr. Strobridge introduced Katherine to the visitor,
who turned out to be the beautiful lady he had walked
with in the rose garden; and they got on extremely
well. It was the first time Katherine had ever chatted,
as practically an equal, alone with a member of society
except her employer.</p>

<p>The stranger was charming, and insisted that she
should come down to play again in the drawing-room
after dinner.</p>

<p>Another occasion for the black frock to be worn!
And a chance not to be wasted for observation as to
behaviour! Katherine, when evening came, made he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>rself
look her very best, and was waiting demurely by
the piano as the ladies entered the room. From this
position she attracted no attention until some of them
wanted to play. The guest she had accompanied was
again graciously sweet to her, and some of the others
joined in the conversation while they strummed and
pulled about the songs.</p>

<p>There was something arresting in Katherine's type
which called for notice when people were near enough
to observe details of her mousy fair hair that had no
touch of gold in it, but always glistened grey, and her
wonderfully pale skin and dark brows, giving her
strange eyes that intense shadowed mystery which
aroused interest.</p>

<p>Gerard, who joined the party by the piano when the
men came in, watched her silently. She had studied to
obtain an air of distinction, and Gerard, whose love did
not blind his fastidious critical faculties, remarked that
there was a real advance in this direction since the
Christmas night when he had last seen her in evening
dress. She did not look so sullen either and answered
with fluency and ease when she was addressed, and not
in the monosyllabic fashion of former days.</p>

<p>An elderly politician spoke to her. He seemed delighted
with her conversation, and indicated by a gesture
that she should sit down beside him when the songs
were over and she was about to slip away out of the
room.</p>

<p>Katherine was not at all certain whether she ought
to stay or not, but Lady Garribardine at that moment
came up and said casually, "You must not go to bed
yet, Miss Bush, perhaps they will sing again; wait here
and talk to Sir John."</p>

<p>And so bidden, Katherine was delighted to obey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
and used her intelligence to be agreeable and sympathetic.
Gerard continued to watch her and felt pride
in her.</p>

<p>"Your secretary is having a great success to-night,
isn't she, Seraphim?" he said to his aunt.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and it is deserved; the girl is one in a thousand.
I think I shall encourage Sir John for her; he
is longing for a wife, and has a tidy seven thousand a
year, and only rare attacks of gout. She could manage
him capitally and be of real use to the party. She will
never let her heart interfere with her ambitions!"</p>

<p>"He would make an ideal husband!" Mr. Strobridge's
tone was sardonic. "A lover in that case would
be an immediate necessity&mdash;by all means, Seraphim,
press the match!"</p>

<p>Her Ladyship gave him one of her shrewd glances
and then she said:</p>

<p>"Come and breakfast with me in my sitting-room
to-morrow morning, G. We can talk it over," and she
chuckled softly.</p>

<p>When Katherine sat by her fire an hour later she set
herself to look carefully over the last five months of her
life, and to mark what they had brought her.</p>

<p>The gain was immense! She had emerged from being
an ordinary shorthand typist at Liv and Dev's to be
an inmate of the house in Berkeley Square, and from
that to be the passion of Gerard Strobridge, and the
valued companion of Lady Garribardine at Blissington.
And now she had spent the evening almost as their equal
and had heard twenty eminent people all talking the
shibboleth of the great world of politics and fashion;
and had not felt totally out of place in their company,
which she knew was not composed of the agreeable fools
of the Christmas party, but contained several politicians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
of distinction, a diplomat or two and a foreign
ambassador.</p>

<p>The contrast was delightful to think about; it even
gave her pleasure to recall Bindon's Green as a foil!
She laughed without any bitterness to herself when she
remembered the bath and the oyster incidents, and several
others of the Lord Algy Period&mdash;and how she had
secretly admired the "rather awful" rooms at the Great
Terminus Hotel; her eye and her taste then so totally
uneducated that in spite of many walks in museums,
she had not been able to distinguish her deplorable deficiencies
in both respects. Oh! What an immeasurable
gulf now separated her from those days! It was a
praiseworthy achievement for only five months. But
she realised more than ever from the conversations she
had heard to-night that she was still very ignorant,
and that constant mixing with this society would be the
only way to give her that polish and confidence which
could enable her to display the really cultivated
thoughts of her mind.</p>

<p>The quickness and lightness with which subtle and
clever sallies were answered&mdash;the perfect ease of everyone!
She knew that she was able to control her own face
and manner to appear at ease, but she could not pretend
that she felt so altogether as yet, except with
Gerard Strobridge, but then Gerard, while her literary
master, was her worshipping servant&mdash;so that was
different!</p>

<p>To please companies of women must now be her aim,
and to avoid talking to any attractive men at all until
she had obtained such a sure place that the jealousy
of her own sex would be immaterial to her. She had
observed that Lady Elton, whose songs she had accompanied,
had a distinct penchant for Mr. Strobridge&mdash;unreturned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
she knew&mdash;but it behooved her to be more
particularly careful. Another woman who had also
spoken to her, a Mrs. Bosanquet, was really interesting&mdash;about
fifty and highly intelligent. Katherine had
carefully watched how she led the conversation in the
group where she stood. As a company all these ladies
were much gentler and more refined in manner than
some of those who had assisted at the tableaux. She
gathered from their remarks that they rather held
themselves apart from these others and indeed laughed
at them good-naturedly. There were sets within sets
evidently, and this was the very inner <i>cr&ecirc;me de la
cr&ecirc;me</i>.</p>

<p>Katherine wondered how long it would be before some
distinct goal presented itself&mdash;that would be for Fate
to decide&mdash;and only those who had made themselves fit
to profit by Fate's chances could hope to succeed in
such a difficult game as she was playing; with every
prejudice of class and sex against her, there was no
time to be wasted in any foolish relaxations!</p>

<p>She wondered if Lady Garribardine had approved of
her behaviour. The old gentleman she had talked to
had been intelligent if pompous, and she had enjoyed
their discussion. She thought of the Chesterfield Letters&mdash;of
what great use they had been to her! She
saw the pitfalls they had enabled her to avoid. Now
her next immediate aim must be to come down into the
drawing-room as frequently as she was allowed. She
determined to make herself of great use, and, if she had
the chance to tackle any bore, so that her mistress
should feel that she was of real service.</p>

<p>At last she retired to bed well pleased with her
evening.</p>

<p>When Mr. Strobridge came into his aunt's sitting-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>room
next morning he found her in a charming neglig&eacute;e
and cap pouring out the coffee.</p>

<p>"I could not wait for you, G.," she told him. "Sit
down, quickly&mdash;there are only two dishes besides bacon
and eggs&mdash;chicken curry and devilled sole&mdash;they are all
on the table at your elbow."</p>

<p>They chatted of several things, the party principally.</p>

<p>"Now I have time, G.&mdash;to hear how it fares with L&auml;o.
How did you escape&mdash;with dignity&mdash;or rather in disgrace?"</p>

<p>"She believes she threw me over; it is extremely fortunate.
Beatrice was an invaluable help." Mr. Strobridge
put some chutney in his curry. "L&auml;o and I are
the greatest friends&mdash;she feels that I fought hard with
my inclinations and made a noble conquest&mdash;by absenting
myself in Egypt! Now she is greatly amused with
a Hussar boy at home on leave from India&mdash;she must
be older than one thought."</p>

<p>His aunt laughed delightedly.</p>

<p>"It is a bad sign certainly. L&auml;o is ageless, though,
anything between twenty-eight and forty-five. We
stay like that for years and then suddenly grow ridiculous!
I believe you have extricated me from the appearance
of that at all events, G. My new toup&eacute;e has
given me a new perspective."</p>

<p>"You are quite beautiful now, Seraphim."</p>

<p>"My golden ones were a habit. It has been a source
of great gratification to me to watch how my friends
have taken the alteration&mdash;even Miss Bush made a faint
exclamation when she first saw it!"</p>

<p>"She is usually very self-contained."</p>

<p>"G., that girl is a wonder&mdash;have you anything to tell
me about her?"</p>

<p>"Nothing except that I agree with you that she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
the most naturally intelligent creature I have ever met."</p>

<p>"Are you in love with her, dear boy?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;extremely."</p>

<p>"To the point of unhappiness?"</p>

<p>"I have not analysed the point&mdash;but it is bound to be
unhappiness since she does not care one atom for me."</p>

<p>"You burnt your fingers that day in the picture
gallery, then? It was a pity I let you."</p>

<p>"The fire was lit before that&mdash;I think it was better
that it flared up&mdash;now I am trying to settle down into
being friends. Seraphim, I want to help her. I do so
admire her courage and her profound common sense.
She frankly desires to cultivate her mind and improve
in every way; the change in her even since Christmas is
remarkable&mdash;do be kind to her and let her come down
sometimes as you did last night."</p>

<p>"I intend to." Lady Garribardine helped herself to
honey. "I am going to take her to Paris with me next
week and then we shall be in London&mdash;there it will be
more difficult."</p>

<p>"Seraphim, have I your permission really to teach
her things?"</p>

<p>Her Ladyship laughed her bubbling laugh.</p>

<p>"It quite depends what things&mdash;to love you, a married
man? Certainly not! To improve her own intellect&mdash;perhaps."</p>

<p>"It is, alas! to do the latter, dearest of aunts,
but&mdash;&mdash;" and here his voice vibrated with unwonted
feeling, "I tell you frankly that if I did not know that
the case is perfectly hopeless, and that I could never
succeed in making her care for me, I believe I would
brave even your wrath and attempt to win her."</p>

<p>"As what&mdash;your mistress?" rather tartly.</p>

<p>Mr. Strobridge shrugged his shoulders slightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>"I would marry her willingly if Beatrice would divorce
me&mdash;such things can be arranged."</p>

<p>"Yes, Beatrice is an excellent creature, as you often
say&mdash;but since Miss Bush will have none of you, you
had better stick to Beatrice, she has done you so many
good turns. Think of L&auml;o!"</p>

<p>Then as she saw the look of pain and weariness upon
his much-loved face, she got up and did what she had
perhaps not done for quite ten years, she put her kind
arm round his neck and pulled his head back against
her ample bosom.</p>

<p>"Dearest boy," she whispered softly, "I cannot bear
that anything should really hurt you. What course is
the right one to pursue, so that you shall not have more
pain? We must think it out."</p>

<p>He was deeply touched and rested there comforted
by her fond affection.</p>

<p>"Let me see her now and then in peace without subterfuge,
so that I may help her with her education&mdash;and
then in the autumn I think I will take that chance
of being sent to Teheran&mdash;Seraphim, do you remember
the afternoon she typed the charity things, when
I came up to tea with you, you said I was depressed,
and I said it was the shadow of coming events? Well,
how true it has proved&mdash;that is the first time I ever
noticed her, and once before you had remarked that
you feared I should one day be profoundly in love."</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine stooped and kissed his forehead.</p>

<p>"Alas!" she said. "But you were too fine, dear G.,
to go on drifting forever from the Alice Southerwoods
to the L&auml;os; it was bound to come with your temperament.
I really wish you could marry this girl and have
some splendid little sons for me to adopt and leave
some of my money to."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>"I would ask nothing better of Fate," and his eyes
became suffused with light at the thought. His aunt
sat down again and began peeling an apple.</p>

<p>"You would have no objection to that despised domestic
relationship, then&mdash;it would not even appear
bourgeois, eh?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least."</p>

<p>"G.,&mdash;how the whole world is full of shams. This
ridiculous thing called marriage! What a problem,
and no light on the subject! A suitable marriage is
perfect happiness, the obligations are joys and pleasures,
and it does not seem to be allowed to occur more
than once in a hundred years. All the rest are in
gradations of unsuitableness and fret and boredom. It
makes me shudder now when I see people standing at
the altar, swearing to love forever&mdash;nine-tenths of them
not even taking in the meaning of the vows they are
making&mdash;and a large percentage going through them
for some ultimate end entirely disconnected with love
or desire for the partner they are being bound to&mdash;it is
tragic."</p>

<p>Mr. Strobridge agreed.</p>

<p>"I am convinced," Her Ladyship went on, now
warmed to her subject, "that much unhappiness would
be avoided if no vows were made at all, but the parson
merely joined the hands and said a prayer over them to
ask that they might go on desiring each other, and
that ended the business. I believe truly that the
actual breaking of the vow acts in some mysterious occult
fashion and draws penalties of misery upon the
breakers."</p>

<p>"What a disturbing thought!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;because it is not really the infidelities which
can be sins, they are merely human nature&mdash;it is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
breaking of the given word which draws the current of
disaster."</p>

<p>"I expect you are quite right&mdash;the whole thing is infernal&mdash;and
yet we must have some sort of union recognised
by the state or chaos would ensue."</p>

<p>"Obviously&mdash;and as marriage now stands there seem
to be only three ways of supporting it. One," and she
ticked them off on her fat fingers&mdash;"to grow to that
abstract state of good when to keep a vow against inclination
in itself brings happiness; two, to behave decently
to the legal partner, and with propriety before
the world, and then if necessary to have mistresses or
lovers as the case may be; or&mdash;three&mdash;for the state to
allow a man to have several wives, and the woman, if she
desires it, a change of husbands!"</p>

<p>Mr. Strobridge handed his cup for more coffee.</p>

<p>"Most of us are quite out of the running for the first,
the third would be unworkable, Seraphim, so I see no
help for it; the second course is the only possible one
for half the poor devils in the world."</p>

<p>"Probably&mdash;then the greatest pains ought to be
taken to keep up appearances so that those who live up
to the first may not have their feelings outraged. No
one should show a bad public example. The facts of
straying fancy cannot be altered until human nature
changes&mdash;an unlikely event!&mdash;so the best we can do is
to hide irregularities under a cloak of virtuous hypocrisy.
It helps many good and weak people to keep up
a general standard, but there must be something wrong
in the original scheme, G., if we are obliged to do this."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly. It is the one, however, which has
kept all sensible societies going since the beginning of
civilisation and will continue to do so while there are
two sexes in the world. But all this does not help me in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
my present case of being madly in love with a woman
whom I may not have as either wife or mistress. Friendship
is the only cold comfort left to me!"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut! Half a loaf is better than no bread!"</p>

<p>"You think she might marry Sir John?" There was
hope in his tone.</p>

<p>"Why not? Only I don't feel sure that he deserves
such a prize. For me she is quite a marvellous character,
and we could perhaps find her something young
and handsome."</p>

<p>Mr. Strobridge jumped up with a start. This idea
was altogether unpalatable to him.</p>

<p>"How shocking! Seraphim, that might be a creature
a woman would adore!"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Concentrate upon friendship, my dear boy!&mdash;If she
has once said you nay, the r&ocirc;le of lover is not for you&mdash;no
matter whom she marries!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>


<p>Time passed. A year went by after this with a
gradual but unmistakable upward advance on
the part of Katherine Bush. Moments of depression
and discouragement came, of course, but her
iron will carried her beyond them. All would go well
for a while, and then would come a barrier, as it were,
which was difficult to climb, and which would baffle her
intentions for a week or two, and then she would surmount
it, and race onward.</p>

<p>Her manipulation of Gerard Strobridge was masterly.
She never permitted him to go beyond the
bounds of friendship, and he gradually grew to entertain
the deepest worship and respect for her, which
influenced his whole life. She spurred him on in his
career, while obtaining from him all the polish his cultivated
mind could bestow. Lady Garribardine watched
the passage of events with her wise old eyes, assisting
them, moreover, when she deemed it necessary.</p>

<p>If Katherine's dominion over her beloved nephew was
for his good, she must not let class prejudice stand in
the way of her sympathy. The world for Sarah Garribardine
was full of incredible fools, who, however strong
their desire might be for a given end, were yet too
stupid to see that their actions and methods&mdash;nearly
always inspired by personal vanity&mdash;militated against
the attainment of that end, and so they went on their
blundering way, continually surprised at their own
want of success!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the quality of reasoning and of analysis in
her secretary which grew to interest her most deeply.
Katherine was her perpetual study, inasmuch as she
stood so far apart from the world of fools.</p>

<p>Their visit to Paris had been a great experience for
Katherine. She took the place historically, not as she
had taken it before, as the setting for a love dream.
She had had a recurrence of the violent longing for
Lord Algy when they arrived at the Gare du Nord, that
strangely sudden seizure of passion to which she seemed
periodically subject; when she knew that if at the moment
Fate were to offer him to her again she would find
the temptation of acceptance too strong to resist. She
was afterwards always extremely thankful that this did
not occur, and that she was given time to resume her
self-command.</p>

<p>When first she drove down the Champs Elys&eacute;es, a
strange sense of fear came over her&mdash;what if after all
that Palatial Hotel episode in her life should have
power one day to raise up its ghost and destroy the
fabric of her ambitions? The more she saw of the great
world, the more she realised that such a breach of convention,
such a frank laying aside of all recognised
standards of morality, would never be forgiven if discovered.
Incidents of the kind occurred every day, but
must always be rigorously kept out of sight. She grew
to understand that it is a much more punishable offence
to hold unorthodox views and act honestly by
them, than to profess orthodox, stringent virtue, and
continually blink at the acting against conscience, by
secret indulgences!</p>

<p>One day it chanced that she could discuss the point
with her mistress.</p>

<p>"You must remember the good of the community always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
first, girl," Lady Garribardine had said. "If you
want to benefit humanity you must not be too much
occupied with the individual. For the good of the community
certain standards must be kept up, and sensible
people should put on blinkers when examining the frailties
of human nature. Nature says one thing and civilisation
and orthodox morality another; there must logically
be an eternal conflict going on between the two
and the only chance for souls to achieve orthodox morality
is for hypocrisy to assist them by hiding bad
examples given when nature has had an outburst and
won the game. If you won't conform to these practical
rules it is wiser and less harmful to your neighbours
for you to go and live in the wilds&mdash;I am all for
<i>tenue</i>, I am all for the uplifting of the soul where it
is possible, and decency and good taste where it is
not."</p>

<p>"I see," responded Katherine. "One must in this, as
in all other things, look to the end."</p>

<p>"You have indeed said it!" Her Ladyship cried.
"That faculty is the quintessence of statesmanship, as
it is of wisdom, and one we never see displayed by a
radical government!"</p>

<p>As the season went on in London, various peeps at
society were afforded Katherine, and as her eyes
opened, and the keenness of her understanding developed,
she learned many useful lessons.</p>

<p>On rare Saturday afternoons, she visited the museums
again with Gerard Strobridge, to her intense
delight, and with much pain as well as pleasure to him,
and when the big Saturday to Monday parties came
down to Blissington, Lady Garribardine often found
her secretary invaluable for the entertainment of unavoidable
bores.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus by the autumn, when Gerard's aching soul and
denied passions thought to take solace in flight on that
mission to Teheran, Katherine Bush was an established
institution at tea time, and had acquired the art of conversation
in a degree which would have pleased Chesterfield
himself!</p>

<p>To make herself liked by women was the immediate
objective she had laid down for herself. Of what use
to gain the little pleasure by the way, of the gratification
of her vanity from the incense of men? She must
wait until some one man appeared upon the scene, the
securing of whom would be her definite goal&mdash;then she
could pursue her aims without the stumbling-block of
female antagonism.</p>

<p>She learned many things from her employer: tolerance&mdash;kindness
of heart&mdash;supreme contempt for all
shams, apart from that of necessary moral hypocrisy,
which seeming paradox she grew to realise was a sensible
assistance to the attainment of a general moral
ideal. Her wits sharpened, her brain expanded, her
cultivation increased and her manners assumed an exquisite
refinement and graciousness; and when the second
Christmas came and the New Year of 1913, no one
could possibly have discovered the faintest trace of
Bindon's Green, or of the lower middle class from which
she had sprung.</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine had materially augmented her
salary, and substantial cheques found their way to poor
Gladys, whose baby was born dead, much to Matilda's
disappointment.</p>

<p>"But it is often like that," she told Katherine as
they walked in the park one Sunday, "with a seven
months' child, and Glad don't take on about it as I
should."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Robert Hartley was firmly determined to go to
America.</p>

<p>"We've had enough hell in these few months, Bob,"
she informed her husband as she was getting better,
"and I am going to be like Katherine and make a career
for myself. I'm tired of your grumbling and your
rudeness to me, and every bit of love I had for you is
gone&mdash;We've no baby&mdash;There's nothing to keep us
chained up together like a pair of animals, and I'm off
to make my fortune&mdash;so I tell you flat."</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Hartley asserted the rights of an English
husband, but to no avail. Gladys had the money
from her sister in her hand to start herself with, and a
warm recommendation from Madame Ermantine, and
so in the early autumn sailed for New York and almost
immediately obtained lucrative employment.</p>

<p>Thus the family at Bindon's Green was reduced to
Matilda, Ethel, and the two young men, and still further
diminished in the New Year by the marriage (and
retirement to a villa of his own!) of Mr. Frederick
Bush with the genteel Mabel Cawber!</p>

<p>The wedding of the pair was a day of unalloyed
pleasure to Matilda. Katherine had man&oelig;uvred so
that she could not possibly be spared to attend it; thus
the festivities were unclouded by the restraint which
her presence&mdash;quite undesired by herself&mdash;always imposed
upon her relations. They were all admittedly
uncomfortable with her, not she with them. They felt
in some vague way that they were of less account in
their own eyes when in her company, and that an impassable
gulf now separated them. They had nothing
to complain of, Katherine gave herself no airs, she
neither patronised them nor talked over their heads, but
a subtle something divided them, and all were glad of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
her seemingly enforced absence. All except the bride,
who was sorry the poor secretary sister-in-law should
not be chastened by witnessing her triumph!</p>

<p>For was she not having four bridesmaids dressed in
pink pongee silk with blue sashes, and two pages to
carry her court train! Pages in "Renaissance" costume.
The Lady Agatha Tollington's were so described
in the <i>Flare</i>, and why should not hers be also?
"Renaissance!" She did not know what the word
meant, but it had such a nice sound and seemed so well
to fit the picturesque suits advertised as copied from
Millais' immortal Bubbles which had been secured at
the local emporium to adorn the two smug-faced infants
who would carry&mdash;very shamefacedly it must be admitted&mdash;the
confection of cheap satin and imitation
lace which would depend from Miss Cawber's angular
shoulders.</p>

<p>If Katherine could have seen all that! Miss Cawber
felt that a humbler mien in this obstreperous creature
might have resulted!</p>

<p>But Katherine never saw it, and when Matilda recounted
all the glories to her, she had the awkwardness
to ask why Mabel had indulged in a court train?</p>

<p>"Bridesmaids were natural enough," she said, "if
you all wanted to have some gaiety and a jolly party,
but Fred's wife will never go to Court, so why pages
and a train?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;well," Matilda returned in annoyance, "who's
to know that at Bindon's Green? And it has given her
ever such a tip-top position to begin her home upon.
The Perkins girls and Bob Hartley's mother and cousins
were just mad with envy, and Fred as pleased as
Punch to have such a stunning turn-out at his side to
down the aisle with."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am so glad you are all happy then," Katherine
said kindly.</p>

<p>How merciful, she reflected when she had left her sister
at Stanhope Gate, that their ambitions were so easily
satisfied! How merciful also that only Matilda's
affection for her need count in her future connection
with the family&mdash;and Matilda might at no distant date
be a bride too! The bride of Katherine's old devoted
admirer, Charlie Prodgers! While Ethel announced
her intention of following Gladys' example and migrating
to America the moment she was seventeen, in the
spring.</p>

<p>Thus, visits to Bindon's Green were no longer desired
by the inhabitants of Laburnum Villa, nor of Talbot
Lodge, where Mr. and Mrs. Frederick Bush were
installed, and Katherine felt she could drift from them
all without hurting their feelings, indeed, with mutual
satisfaction.</p>

<p>So the winter of 1912 drew to a close, and the spring
of 1913 came, and with it Gerard Strobridge.</p>

<p>He was well and sunburnt and seemed more resigned
on his first visit after he returned to Blissington accompanied
by Lady Beatrice.</p>

<p>Katherine was pouring out the tea&mdash;now her daily
task&mdash;when he came in, and a glad thrill ran through
her. Would he see any change in her? Would he be
pleased with her advancement? He was her friend, and
her helpmate in literature, and never by word or look
did she recognise that he could feel any other emotion
but a platonic one for her.</p>

<p>Her attractions always struck Gerard afresh after
his absences, and made him remark upon them each
time he returned.</p>

<p>"How beautiful you have grown, Katherine," he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
when presently they had a chance of talking a little
apart. "You are the most wonderful thing in the world&mdash;I
came back hoping to find you less attractive, and
you are just as fascinating as ever&mdash;more so&mdash;Oh! shall
I never make you care the least for me?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"It is a wonder that I should love you so madly, when
you are as cold as ice to me, and never melt&mdash;I believe
you could see me on the rack without turning a
hair&mdash;if it suited your purpose!"</p>

<p>"Probably."</p>

<p>But she smiled softly, so he asked eagerly:</p>

<p>"Is it so, Katherine?"</p>

<p>"Will you never understand even after the hundreds
and hundreds of talks we have had? I have marked out
a settled, determined path in life which I intend to follow&mdash;so
that even if I loved you I would crush all emotion
out of myself, since indulging in it would ruin my
aims, and drag us both to social perdition meanwhile.
It is extremely fatiguing to have to recommence explaining
our positions every time you come back from
abroad. As a friend I delight in you&mdash;I love our talks,
our discussions and controversies. I have tried in every
way to improve under your tuition, but if you will be
weak and give way to other feelings&mdash;it is you who put
yourself on the rack&mdash;And if you do it I cannot help it,
it cannot change my determination, even if I see you
suffering."</p>

<p>"How can a man worship anything so logical?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; what I do know is that I never
mean to admit that you have any feelings for me but
those I have for you, of warm friendship. I shall always
act as if you were only my friend, and only consider
any of my actions as affecting you from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
point of view. If you are hurt it is your own fault,
I cannot be responsible for the pain."</p>

<p>He clenched his hands with sudden violence.</p>

<p>"And if I refused to bear it&mdash;if I broke all friendship
and never spoke to you again&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p>"You would be quite right to do so if it gave you
any satisfaction. I should miss you&mdash;but I should understand."</p>

<p>He gave a faint groan.</p>

<p>"Well, I have not the strength to throw off your influence.
I always think I have done it when I go to
foreign climes, and I dwell upon the pleasure that your
intellect gives me. I come back quite resigned, but the
first sight of you, the sight of those red, wicked lips and
that white skin drives me mad once more, and I feel I do
not care whether you have any brain or no, in the overwhelming
desire to hold you in my arms."</p>

<p>Katherine gave an exclamation of weariness.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is tiresome that you must always have these
scenes when you return, they spoil everything. You
force me to seem cruel. Why can't you accept the situation?"</p>

<p>"Because I am a man and you are a woman," and his
eyes sought hers with passion, "and all the rest of emotion
is but make-believe; the only real part is the tangible.
To have and to hold, to clasp and to kiss, to
strain the loved one next the heart&mdash;Katherine, you
make me suffer the tortures of the damned."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;you permit yourself to suffer them, that makes
all the difference. If I made you, then I should feel as
wicked as you say my lips look."</p>

<p>Here Lady Beatrice interrupted them in her plaintive,
drawling voice.</p>

<p>"Gerard, can you imagine it! Aunt Sarah has just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
had a letter from Tom Hawthorne by the evening's
post, announcing that L&auml;o has quietly married that boy
in Paris, and they are going to Monte Carlo for their
honeymoon! Isn't it quite too tragic for them, poor
things!"</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine joined the group, with the epistle
in her hand.</p>

<p>"L&auml;o was always a fool, but I believed even the sense
of a rabbit would have kept her from this!"</p>

<p>"They are madly in love, dear Sarah!" old Gwendoline
d'Estaire said sentimentally.</p>

<p>Her ladyship snorted.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut! L&auml;o is forty-two years old and the boy
not more than six and twenty, sixteen years between
them! Quite an immaterial discrepancy while he remained
a lover&mdash;but a menace which even the strongest
brain cannot combat when the creature turns into a
husband. The situation is ridiculous at once. It means
that the woman has to spend her time not only fighting
old age as we all have to do, but watching for every sign
of weariness in the youth, trembling at every fresh
wrinkle in herself, and always on the tiptoe of anxiety,
so that she loses whatever charm lured the poor child
into her net."</p>

<p>"But really L&auml;o had made it so evident&mdash;the affair&mdash;perhaps
she thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That a second wedding ring was essential! Ridiculous
nonsense, Gwendoline! We are not of the <i>bourgeoisie</i>&mdash;there
is an epidemic of these rich widows
rushing these penniless young men into matrimony. No
one objects to their amusing themselves, but these respectable
unions offend the sensibilities at once from
their obvious unsuitableness. The woman loses prestige&mdash;almost
caste, I was going to say. The man grows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
either sheepish or intolerably insolent, and if you notice,
the pair eventually drop out of all agreeable society."</p>

<p>"How awful to contemplate!" and Lady Beatrice
sighed sadly. "To think that after one had <i>pretended</i>
for years that one was full of emotions and sex and
horrible things, one should succumb to them really&mdash;It
is a cruel retribution&mdash;Gerard, aren't you interested?"</p>

<p>For Mr. Strobridge had raised a whimsical eyebrow.</p>

<p>"Perfectly thrilled. I am amply revenged for her indifference
to me!"</p>

<p>"Is it not possible for them to be happy, then?"
Katherine whispered to him in the din of a chorus of remarks
the news had provoked.</p>

<p>"They have about a hundred to one chance for a
few months; then either will suffer, probably both.
Oh! the intolerable bond of matrimony!&mdash;Unless, of
course&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Katherine shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so, if one was not quite sure what
the reason was that one was marrying for, and had
not weighed it and found out if it would be worth while
or no."</p>

<p>"What will you marry for?"</p>

<p>"Contentment, I expect."</p>

<p>"And what is contentment&mdash;only the obtaining of
one's heart's desire."</p>

<p>"I shall not marry unless it is to obtain my heart's
desire," and that sphinxlike smile grew round her
mouth, which always roused Gerard Strobridge's curiosity.
After all this time, he could never quite fathom
what was going on inside that clever brain.</p>

<p>"I refuse to think about it&mdash;Let us talk about some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>thing
else&mdash;books you have been reading&mdash;something I
can do for you."</p>

<p>"There is one thing I would like you to do very much&mdash;only
I do not know if it could be managed. Last
week, Her Ladyship allowed me to go with Miss Arabella
d'Estaire to see the House of Commons. I would
so much like to see the House of Lords and hear a debate
there before the Easter recess. I am trying to
study politics."</p>

<p>"That will not be very difficult. I can get an order
from Blackrod; there will be something to listen to
next week, when I believe my aunt will be in town. I
shall love to gratify your wish, Katherine."</p>

<p>"We must ask Lady Garribardine first if I may."</p>

<p>"Model of circumspection! Of course."</p>

<p>Then the company drifted from the tea table and
Miss Bush returned to her sanctum, while Gerard Strobridge
went up to his aunt's sitting-room.</p>

<p>They talked of numbers of things, and at last that
lady said:</p>

<p>"G.,&mdash;more than ever I understand your passion for
my secretary. I do not even find your fidelity ridiculous;
she is one of the most fascinating creatures I
have ever met. A masterpiece of balance and common
sense, she will rise to the highest position one day&mdash;mark
my words, boy!"</p>

<p>"I daresay&mdash;I cannot feel interested in that. I am
still horribly in love. I thought Teheran had dulled the
ache for her, but it has not."</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine sighed as she arranged a cushion.</p>

<p>"I live in terror that one day she will come and tell
me quite honestly that she has learned all that my situation
can teach her, and that she is going on to something
new."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>"She could not be so ungrateful."</p>

<p>"It would not be ingratitude&mdash;she works for money,
not for love. It would be part of her plan of life. Sentimental
emotion does not enter into it&mdash;that is what
makes her so interesting, and so invaluable."</p>

<p>"But I know, Seraphim, that she has a deep affection
for you&mdash;she has expressed it to me many times.
You are her model for all fine conduct and point of
view."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the girl is devoted to me, I think. Well, we
must hope that she is content here, for I do not know
how I could quite get on without her. I have had her
down for a little at each party during the winter, G.
She literally devours bores for me, and gets all the
cranks into good tempers. And all the women like her;
that shows triumphant astuteness on her part."</p>

<p>"Triumphant! You did not after all marry her to
Sir John while I was away. I almost hoped that you
would do so when I left in October."</p>

<p>"Sir John was willing; he wanted but a hint from me
to have shown all the ardour of a young lover. One
even pictured verses&mdash;it is in this way that it takes
aged politicians. One imagined a discreet wedding and
almost by now the inevitable preparatory layette!&mdash;But
Miss Bush would have none of it! When I approached
her upon the subject she looked me straight in the face
and said quite respectfully, but with a hauteur befitting
a D'Estaire, that she had other views, and while sensible
of my kindness she must decline the honour! I was immensely
diverted."</p>

<p>"Danger is still ahead, then&mdash;She has told me just
now that she means only to marry when she can gain
her heart's desire&mdash;but what that is God&mdash;or the devil&mdash;alone
knows."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Garribardine looked at him shrewdly for a
second; she did not speak, so Mr. Strobridge went on:</p>

<p>"By the way, she wants me to take her and Arabella
to hear a debate in the House of Lords&mdash;may I?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>If he had not been so preoccupied with his own
thoughts he would have remarked his aunt's tone, but
he was absently staring out of the window and did not
even see her face with its sagacious, querying expression.</p>

<p>"She is greatly interested in politics, I believe; she is
well up in them already&mdash;she is well up in everything.
I daresay she could open a bazaar, or give an address
better than I could myself. I can spare her next
Wednesday afternoon when the debate on the Land Bill
will be in full swing. You can arrange it."</p>

<p>"I will.&mdash;Seraphim, isn't it pitiful about poor L&auml;o!&mdash;Younger
or older it would not have mattered quite so
much&mdash;but at forty-two&mdash;Heavens! The only thing
the poor darling had&mdash;her beauty&mdash;won't be worth
looking at in a year or so. The mentality of women is
beyond me, so utterly unaccountable their actions are."</p>

<p>"Not at all, my precious G. They are as plain as a
pikestaff&mdash;only any man can be bamboozled by the silliest
of them. They all answer to type and sex. L&auml;o
has the brains of her type, the female guinea pig, raised
under artificial conditions which have altered, but not
stifled, the guinea pig's strongest instinct&mdash;prolific reproduction.
It came out in L&auml;o, not in the desire to
have a numerous family, but in an intense desire to attract
the male&mdash;<i>pas pour le bon motif, bien entendu!</i>&mdash;but
for variety&mdash;Then she falls in love at a foolish age,
and the emotion, being one of nature, the instinct rights
itself for the moment, and swamps the effect of artificial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
conditions. Hence the passion for the wedding ring&mdash;vows&mdash;the
male in the cage, all unconscious preparation
for a family&mdash;the last thing she would desire, in
fact&mdash;and all sense of proportion lost sight of."</p>

<p>Mr. Strobridge laughed delightedly.</p>

<p>"You should write a 'Guide to the Knowledge of
Women,' Seraphim, for the enlightenment of your men
friends."</p>

<p>His aunt smiled, showing all her strong, well-preserved
white teeth.</p>

<p>"I would like to, but not one of them would speak
to me again, they would tear my new grey <i>toup&eacute;e</i> from
my snowy locks, and denounce me as a liar, because I
would tell the one thing they strongly dislike&mdash;the
truth!"</p>

<p>"Yes, a thoroughly lovable feminine woman loathes
the truth, doesn't she! I have always found my greatest
success with her lay in a distortion of every fact to
suit her personal view. Katherine Bush and yourself,
sweet Aunt, are the only two of your sex that I have
ever met whom a man need not humour, and can speak
his real mind out to."</p>

<p>And with this he kissed her fat hand and took his way
from her presence down the gallery to his room to dress
for dinner.</p>

<p>But all the while Stirling was coaxing the real silver
and auxiliary iron grey waves into a superbly simple
triumph of hairdressing, her ladyship wore a slight
frown of concentrated thought.</p>

<p>What did it mean, this desire on the part of her secretary
to see the House of Lords?</p>

<p>"Vermondsay&mdash;Hankhurst&mdash;Upper Harringway."
She counted over a long list of the names of peers who
frequented Blissington and Berkeley Square&mdash;but at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
the end she shook her head. "No&mdash;none of these&mdash;Who
then&mdash;and what for?"</p>

<p>Katherine Bush was no guinea pig answering to type.
What type was she, by the way? A complicated, conglomerated
mixture, not easy to dissect at any time,
was this new move a manifestation of sex&mdash;or type?</p>

<p>Time alone would show&mdash;Until then the solution must
remain in the lap of the gods. And in all cases, dinner
should not wait, and it behooved a hostess to be
punctual.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>


<p>The outside of the Houses of Parliament had always
affected Katherine. They looked stately
and English&mdash;and when they&mdash;herself and old
Arabella d'Estaire and Gerard&mdash;walked through the
corridors of the House of Lords, and came at last to the
huge vaulted chamber itself, and so to the pen where
they might stand to hear the debate, her heart began
to beat with some strange excitement.</p>

<p>They went into the left side enclosure, and so could
have a facing view of the Opposition benches.</p>

<p>Some member of the Government had just begun a
speech as they entered, and Katherine had time to look
about her. What types to study! And what an atmosphere
of calm, after the scene in the House of Commons
she had witnessed on her visit there! A din of
angry voices and uncontrolled emotion. Here if people
felt anything it did not appear on the surface. Katherine
leaned upon the second carved griffin which helps
to adorn the partition which separates the pen from the
sacred floor of the House itself. From there her eyes
travelled from face to face opposite her. She recognised
several, indeed many whom she had seen either in
London or at Blissington&mdash;but who were those others,
some with features far from aristocratic?</p>

<p>She now examined the Ministerial benches, and made
many reflections, while she only half listened to the
rather lame string of sentences which were falling from
a very refined-looking, carefully preserved gentleman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
who seemed little interested in his subject, and almost
ashamed to be speaking from that side of the House.</p>

<p>Then from the end by the throne two newcomers entered,
and took their seats, one on the front Opposition
bench.</p>

<p>For the moment, Katherine's eye had followed the
younger of the two who went towards the back, so that
she did not become conscious of the personality of the
other until, at the conclusion of the Minister's speech,
he rose and laid some papers down upon the table in
front of him amidst a sudden thrill of interest which
noticeably ran through the assembly.</p>

<p>He was a very tall and arrogant-looking person,
rather thin and upright; and in everything about him
there was a strange old-world suggestion, which characterised
even the cutting and brushing of his hair and
the shape of his coat. The brow was lofty and broad,
and the thin iron-grey locks were combed straight back
from it, and seemed to be perhaps rather longer than
those of the young men. He had very large eyes deeply
set, probably dark blue, Katherine thought, and his
nose was prominently aquiline. He was clean-shaven,
all but a small pair of close-cut whiskers, and this with
some peculiarity about the shirt, and the frockcoat he
wore, as well as a black satin stock, stamped him as
someone of an altogether different generation&mdash;century,
Katherine had almost said to herself!</p>

<p>Who could he be?</p>

<p>There was some picture she had seen which he reminded
her of. She thought for a minute. Yes, it was
a certain print which hung in a passage at Blissington,
of the Duke of Wellington in evening dress, a profile,
with the ribbon of the Garter across his breast. This
man had something of the same personality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>His whole appearance was so unusual, so almost
startling, that had anyone else attempted to achieve the
same result he would have looked either vulgarly dramatic
or quite grotesque, but with this man even the
old-fashioned clothes with their suspicion of a by-gone
dandyism seemed to add to his immense distinction.
Katherine thought that if she could have drawn a picture
of a typical aristocrat of the Tory persuasion, of
perhaps a hundred years ago, this man would have
made a perfect model.</p>

<p>And now he began to speak!</p>

<p>And of all the voices she had ever heard or admired
from beyond the half-high glass screen at Liv and
Dev's, or listened to in her present situation, none had
ever struck her as so ultra refined as the perfectly modulated
tones now vibrating through the house.</p>

<p>His words were selected with judgment and grace,
and showed the command of an uncommon vocabulary.
She had thought Gerard Strobridge's sentences were
well-chosen, and cultivated, but they would sound quite
modern and almost colloquial, she felt, compared with
the highly-polished flow of language which poured forth
from this clear-cut mouth. The whole mien of the man
expressed intense pride and dignity, and a perfect unself-consciousness.
He gesticulated very little and kept
one hand with the thumb resting above a button of his
fastened coat, so that she could see his hand plainly,
and its shape, which was in keeping with the rest of his
appearance, and on his little finger was a great graven
emerald, or some green stone in a ring, which caught a
ray of light and sparkled for a second.</p>

<p>How was it that so noticeable a personage had never
been to Berkeley Square or Blissington?</p>

<p>He was of Her Ladyship's political convictions, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
and must be of importance to occupy so prominent a
place. And presently she began to take in the words
he was saying, and gathered from a sentence which remarked
upon his "long absence from your Ladyship's
House" that he must have been for some time out of
England.</p>

<p>Then she grew fascinated with the speech itself, it
was so witty and filled with an exquisite sarcasm. Such
must have been the speeches of Chesterfield, she thought,
in this same House of Lords more than a century and
a half ago.</p>

<p>How old could he be? Fifty&mdash;forty-five&mdash;forty? It
was impossible to say.</p>

<p>Suddenly she was conscious of a deep enthralled interest
affecting her, and she turned and whispered to
Mr. Strobridge at her side:</p>

<p>"Who is that man speaking now&mdash;I would so much
like to know?"</p>

<p>"The Duke of Mordryn&mdash;is he not a type? The last
real Tory left in this age."</p>

<p>And then Katherine remembered that letters addressed
to this name, and written in Lady Garribardine's
own hand, had often gone with the rest to be
posted, always to addresses abroad, ever since she had
been in her service. And often, too, she recalled, the
Duke had been spoken of as being here or there, and
gradually on his way home, but nothing about him had
particularly interested or struck her, except the name
Mordryn&mdash;it was a perfect name!</p>

<p>She began piecing together what she knew about him.
At Liv and Dev's she had been obliged to know a good
deal about all Dukes; their sub-titles, son's courtesy
titles, and family names. This string came back to her
mechanically&mdash;"Duke of Mordryn, Marquis of Valfreyne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Earl of Rievaulx" and a number of Baronies,
while the family appellation was Monluce, and the chief
place of several residences Valfreyne in Dorsetshire.
She remembered too that the Duchess had died less than
two years ago.</p>

<p>After this her absorbed interest concentrated upon
the man himself and she almost felt a little breathless
when he sat down; and a moment or two after, when
he seemed to have leisure to look about him, she met his
eyes and she could see that they were indeed a very
dark blue and that his gaze consciously rested upon
her.</p>

<p>She did not turn hers away; she was fascinated, and
slowly there came a thought to her:</p>

<p>"This is what fate means for me&mdash;" And for a few
seconds she felt faint and icy cold, so great was her
emotion.</p>

<p>The unknown goal of all her striving was revealed at
last! The position of this man's wife would be the
greatest to be achieved in England, for prestige and
influence. <i>And it should be hers.</i></p>

<p>She heard and saw and knew nothing which happened
after this, only what was spoken and done by the Duke,
and presently, Miss Arabella d'Estaire growing tired,
they went out, their exit accelerated by Katherine who
saw that His Grace had risen and was coming their way.
They stopped for a second just at the place where the
hats are left and he caught them up and shook hands
with Mr. Strobridge and Miss d'Estaire.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to see you, Gerard," he said, "it is
good to be at home again," and then he gave some gallant
greeting to Miss d'Estaire, and paused, absently
looking at Katherine, who stood by demurely, presenting
an attractive picture in her grey suit and hat. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
care was now taken of her ample tresses, which were
arranged to show the smallness of her head, and every
article of her garments was chosen to express unobtrusive
distinction. For many months her astute intelligence
had been turned upon the enhancing of her attractions,
with wonderful result.</p>

<p>"Miss Bush&mdash;the Duke of Mordryn," Mr. Strobridge
was obliged to murmur, and Katherine bowed and
waited to see if the Duke would speak. He did, with
that aloof but gracious courtesy which he showed to all
women.</p>

<p>"You have come to hear our highly futile debate in
this mutilated chamber&mdash;I hope you were not too
bored."</p>

<p>"I was very much interested," and she looked
straight into his eyes in the way she did when she intended
to compel attention.</p>

<p>As Gerard Strobridge watched her, he suddenly felt
a twinge of fear. He refused to acknowledge the
thought which presented itself, but indicated that they
should go on.</p>

<p>The Duke meanwhile had not been unaffected by
Katherine's magnetic eyes&mdash;he felt a spark of interest
and so continued the conversation for a minute, but
finally had to give way to Gerard's evident desire to
move forward.</p>

<p>"Tell Her Ladyship that I am coming to lunch to-morrow.
I only crossed last night, and have had no
time to answer her note awaiting me. I hope she is
well and has not allowed this modern rush and turmoil
to spoil her enchanting wit."</p>

<p>When they got out into the open air, Katherine noticed
that Mr. Strobridge had a fierce and rather
hunted expression on his face. He got into the taxi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
after the two ladies without a word, and said very little
as they drove to Miss d'Estaire's tiny flat in Knightsbridge.</p>

<p>"Perhaps as it is so fine you will let me dismiss the
cab and we might walk across the Park," he suggested
as he rejoined Katherine after seeing Miss Arabella in
at the door. And she consented.</p>

<p>The air was crisp and fresh and the dusk was gathering.
It was a quarter to six o'clock.</p>

<p>They turned towards Stanhope Gate and walked in
silence. Then Mr. Strobridge stopped suddenly and
drew Katherine to a chair.</p>

<p>"Katherine," he said, and his voice was husky. "Is
it so?"</p>

<p>"Is what so?" she questioned, to be quite certain
what he meant.</p>

<p>"Is the Duke to be your objective?"</p>

<p>She did not answer. She was weighing things. Gerard's
assistance would be necessary for the pursuance
of a plan which had been forming in her head since she
had left the Houses of Parliament. She was swift to
decide, and swift to act at critical moments in her life.</p>

<p>"Do you think you have any right to ask me such
a question?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What right?"</p>

<p>"I love you."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"No, I will never admit it."</p>

<p>"It is true enough&mdash;Oh! Katherine, there is nothing
I would not do for you and you know it, only I cannot
help wanting to be certain if I am to expect the worst.
I feared it at once when you looked into his eyes. Has
my doom come at last then?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are paying me a great compliment; you seem
to think that the matter lies only in my hands."</p>

<p>"You will accomplish anything you desire."</p>

<p>She did not speak.</p>

<p>"Katherine," he pleaded, and there was anguish in
his voice, "tell me the truth, whether I have the right
to ask it or no. The idea has come to you that this
would be worth winning, this position&mdash;has it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He is fifty-three years old, Mordryn&mdash;but a fifty-three
which women adore&mdash;You would probably fall in
love with him also."</p>

<p>"It is possible."</p>

<p>"Can you expect me to be anything but pained
then?"</p>

<p>"I have always told you that I consider you only
as a friend, and that I only view your emotions for me
as those of friendship; therefore there should be no
pain even in such an idea according to my view."</p>

<p>"There is."</p>

<p>"I am sorry."</p>

<p>"But it does not change your determination?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I understand a man's killing a woman sometimes,"
and he clenched his hands passionately.</p>

<p>"So do I&mdash;when she deceives him, never because she
is honest and unvarying. I have never deceived you or
led you to hope for anything but friendship&mdash;that you
have in full, and you have hundreds of times promised
me yours; if you meant it I now ask you to give me a
proof of it."</p>

<p>"What proof?"</p>

<p>"I wish to meet the Duke&mdash;not as Lady Garribardine's
secretary; that would prejudice him too much,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
naturally! I want to meet him in the evening at dinner
as a guest. I want to talk to him and see for myself
what he is like, and if he is as wonderful as he looks.
Only you could arrange this. If you asked him to dinner
and asked me and Miss Arabella or Miss Gwendoline
d'Estaire it would be possible, would it not?"</p>

<p>He was staring at her now, overcome by her masterly
frankness. No&mdash;she would never deceive him, he
realised that and also that nothing of his will could
ever impose upon hers. He knew he was impotent as
a factor in the determining of her plans; all he could
do to keep her favour was to fall in with them.</p>

<p>Her face, white as a lily in the growing dusk, was
calm and cold and beautiful. He had never desired
her more&mdash;but that fastidiousness in him, that power
of detachment which could appreciate skill even when
exercised against his own interests, asserted itself, and
helped him. She was so wonderful a character, he must
assist her even to his own pain.</p>

<p>"I suppose it would be possible&mdash;Beatrice goes down
to Allerton to-morrow until after Easter. I expect I
could arrange it for Friday night if I can only get the
Duke&mdash;he will be awfully busy these days&mdash;but perhaps
if I ask him at once I might catch him&mdash;" Then he
thought a moment&mdash;"Yes&mdash;I've got a new case of miniatures
I bought last week at an odd sale. I could beguile
him on the pretext of giving me his opinion as
to whether or no two of them are really Cosways. You
see to what a state of abject slavery you have reduced
me."</p>

<p>"No, I have not&mdash;you are being merely a loyal
friend."</p>

<p>"To-night at dinner I will ask my aunt if you may
dine&mdash;I have some boring country friends coming in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
any case that night and she will let me have you to
help to entertain them, I expect. You are supposed to
be extraordinarily talented as an entertainer of bores!"</p>

<p>He could not keep some of the bitterness he was feeling
out of his voice. Katherine looked at him reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I thought you would perhaps have understood&mdash;and
been kind."</p>

<p>He responded at once to her tone.</p>

<p>"Darling&mdash;I will&mdash;you know it. I will show you that
I am indeed your devoted friend; will that please you?"</p>

<p>She inwardly appreciated his sacrifice and her eyes
shone softly upon him.</p>

<p>His face was haggard and looked hungry&mdash;its expression
would have surprised the many women who
had loved him, and on whom he had turned a transient
smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, that will please me," and her voice was sweet.
"Now tell me about him. I remember to have read in
the papers some time ago that the Duchess had died."</p>

<p>"He has had an awful life&mdash;the Duchess was mad.
She was a Thorval, a cousin of my wife's, and went
more or less off her head soon after they were married
about twenty-eight years ago. Then for more than
fifteen years she was extremely peculiar, but not quite
bad enough to be entirely shut up. Only of course it
made it impossible for him to have friends or to entertain
and enjoy his great position. Then she became
quite mad and had to be isolated and by this time
Adeliza, the only child, began to show signs of derangement,
too, and so he had the horror of seeing the same
thing occurring over again. About two years ago the
Duchess died and fortunately soon after Adeliza caught
scarlet fever and died also, just before you came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
my aunt's&mdash;and then Mordryn started on a long voyage
round the world to try and make a break and forget&mdash;and
he has been abroad ever since, and only returned
last night."</p>

<p>"Poor man, then he did not obtain much pleasure
from his great position?"</p>

<p>"Not in England&mdash;but one must suppose that he has
had some kind of consolations in all these years. He
was often in Paris and has always been extremely attractive,
but he is a great gentleman, and there have
never been any scandals about him."</p>

<p>"And now all those ugly shadows have been removed
from his life and he is free&mdash;" Katherine drew in her
breath a little.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is free," Gerard concurred gloomily. "He
is a most intimate friend of my aunt's; you will see him
constantly at Blissington."</p>

<p>"Where I am the secretary&mdash;yes. Ah! if you knew
how I long sometimes to be&mdash;myself&mdash;and not to have
to act meekness&mdash;Ah! you would know then how grateful
I shall be if you can give me this one evening of
happiness."</p>

<p>He was touched, she so seldom showed any emotion.
He felt rewarded for some of his sufferings.</p>

<p>"You shall have as perfect a time as I can secure
for you, Katherine, dear girl&mdash;" and he bent forward
and took her hand. "You would adorn any position in
the world&mdash;but if Mordryn were not a most splendid
character I would not help you to meet him&mdash;He is&mdash;One
of the finest in the world&mdash;and I will try&mdash;I promise
you I will try not to let any jealous envy stand
in your way."</p>

<p>"You are a dear after all," and she returned the pressure
of his fingers before she drew hers away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a strange light in her eyes as she walked
up the stairs to her room in Berkeley Square. A wonderful
vista had suddenly opened itself before her, with
a mountain in the distance all of shining gold. It
seemed that it must always have been there but that
some mist had hidden it which was now rolled away.</p>

<p>What if she should be able to reach this splendid
gilded mountain top&mdash;some day?&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A glorious end to aim at in any case, and she shut
her white teeth firmly&mdash;and sitting down by her open
window began steadily to think.</p>

<p>That night fate held a surprise in store for her. She
was going to the theatre with Matilda, a periodical
treat which that sister greatly enjoyed. They went in
the dress circle and saw the show, two unobserved units
in the crowd. As it was for Matilda's pleasure she was
left to choose what she would see. It was always either
a Lyceum melodrama or a musical comedy, and this
night it chanced to be the latter, and one newly put on,
so the audience was less remarkably homely than
usual.</p>

<p>Who and what were the audiences at theatres? This
Katherine often asked herself. And while Matilda enjoyed
what was happening on the stage, she studied
the types around her.</p>

<p>Who invented such hairdressing? Who designed
such clothes? Whence came they and whither did they
go?</p>

<p>This particular night Katherine and Matilda were
rather at the side of the dress circle a row or two back,
so that they could see a good deal of the stalls; and
towards the end of the first act Katherine's languid attention
suddenly became riveted upon two particularly
well brushed male heads in the front row. Their owners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
must have come in while she had been looking at the
stage. There was something quite uniquely spruce
about young Englishmen's heads, she knew, and they
were all very much alike of a certain class, but the
fairer of these two was painfully familiar; it belonged
to Lord Algy and to no one else. He had returned
from Egypt then! He was there within a few yards
of her. Oh! why was it such pain to see him again?</p>

<p>Her heart beat to suffocation, she felt every pulse
in her body tingle with excitement, and then she felt a
little sick&mdash;and for a few minutes she could not have
risen from her seat.</p>

<p>Matilda turned for a moment and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, my goodness gracious! Kitten! Whatever is
the matter, dear?"</p>

<p>Then Katherine recollected herself and answered a
little shakily:</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;the heat I suppose&mdash;I am all right
now though, and isn't this a funny scene! Don't let
us talk and spoil it."</p>

<p>And Matilda, reassured, gladly again turned to the
stage. So Katherine sat on, fighting her battle alone.
She forced herself to look at her whilom lover with
calm&mdash;and watch every movement of his attractive
head. He appeared well and bronzed and handsomer
than ever, she could see as he turned to speak to his
companion, and she almost fancied she could hear the
tones of his voice. Then she made herself analyse
things. Did she really love him still?</p>

<p>Then gradually she became more controlled as she
realised that if she kept her eyes fixed upon him like
this the magnetic power of her gaze would certainly
cause him to look round presently and see her, and
that above everything she did not want this to occur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>So she turned her attention to the stage and forced
herself to listen to what was being sung.</p>

<p>The act was soon over, and then she saw Lord Algy's
perfect figure rise to go out. That was "Jack Kilcourcy"
she thought, probably, with him, about whom
she had so often heard&mdash;and perhaps they had come
to see some special beauty in the chorus, and would go
on to supper later at the Savoy or elsewhere. Oh,
no!&mdash;she would not allow herself to feel any more; she
had surely passed beyond such things!</p>

<p>The second act came and went, and the third, and
when it was over she hurried Matilda out, in a desire
to escape before the stall crowd could mingle with
theirs in the doorway.</p>

<p>It was raining a little when they came to the door,
and there stood Lord Algy talking with his caressing
devoted air to a lovely woman in black, whom Katherine
had noticed in one of the boxes. He did not see her,
as, clutching Matilda's arm, she shrank away among
the bedraggled people beyond the lights, and there she
paused and turned for a last look at him, and saw him
follow the lady into a smart car, the door of which was
being held open by a motor groom; it had just driven
up.</p>

<p>"We will have a taxi, Tild," she said. "Let us walk
on and find one. I can't stand an omnibus to-night."</p>

<p>She drove Matilda to Victoria first, and then went
back to Berkeley Square, a rather damp creature in
body and soul. And when she was in bed, the tears
would trickle down her cheeks. It was all hateful!
The dress circle&mdash;the rain&mdash;the cab&mdash;the dependence&mdash;and
last of all Lord Algy and the lovely woman in
black!</p>

<p>Then her sense of the value of things came back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
again; her indomitable spirit revived, and before she
fell asleep she knew that once for all she had banished
any lingering regrets and that she would play for the
great stakes in the game of her ambition with a zest as
strong as the desire for love&mdash;that love which she now
realized had been mainly an affair of the senses and
which was over and dead.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>


<p>That night after dinner when the guests had left
the house in Berkeley Square, Mr. Strobridge
asked his aunt if she would lend him Miss Bush
for Friday night to help him to entertain some bores.
Beatrice would be away, and he really felt he could not
face them alone. Gwendoline or Arabella would come,
too. Katherine had dined at the Strobridges' house in
Brook Street once or twice before, for similar reasons,
and the request therefore did not seem unusual. But
Gerard knew his Seraphim too well not to be aware that
when she heard that Mordryn had dined also she might
suspect some plot, and would then very possibly be
mildly annoyed with him, and really angry with Katherine.
Every scrap of his diplomatic gift would have
to be employed over this. He was going to be at the
luncheon next day which the Duke had announced his
intention of attending. He must so manage the conversation
that miniatures were discussed, and then in
aunt's hearing Mordryn could be asked to come and
inspect them as a mere afterthought. If this failed
to allay all suspicion of underlying intention in the
affair, he would have boldly to tell his aunt the truth,
only taking the whole credit&mdash;or blame of the idea&mdash;upon
his own shoulders&mdash;No reflection must fall upon
Katherine.</p>

<p>Her Ladyship announced casually that, yes, he
might take the secretary and welcome if he returned
her not too late at night; she had to be up early in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
the morning as she was starting on a holiday of a few
days' duration. The dutiful nephew thanked his aunt,
and requested her to let Miss Bush know that she would
be wanted on Friday if she would be kind enough to
come.</p>

<p>But Lady Garribardine was preoccupied with a subject
much nearer her heart, and turned to it at once.</p>

<p>"I am dying to see Mordryn, G. I wish I had known
he was going to speak to-day and I would have gone
to the House; he felt it his duty, I suppose&mdash;this
wretched Land Bill! How did he look? And did you
get a word with him? I shall see him to-morrow, of
course."</p>

<p>Mr. Strobridge gave the message that he had been
asked to give, and vouchsafed the information that the
Duke had appeared as usual and was altogether charming
as ever.</p>

<p>"It is to be hoped he will get some good out of life
now that he is free at last from those mad women."</p>

<p>Her Ladyship's face assumed a strange expression.
She sat down in her usual armchair with an air of
fatigue.</p>

<p>"Your words strike home, G.&mdash;for you know I made
his marriage&mdash;in those far back ignorant days when
no one thought of heredity or such things. I literally
married him off to Laura almost against his will, because
he was utterly devoted to me and I to him, and
the situation was becoming impossible, over ten years
between our ages, his immense position and mine&mdash;and
Garribardine jealous&mdash;There was nothing else for it.
Laura was a sweet, foolish creature then, beautiful and
of no account. I felt she would never replace me in
his affection, and in those days, nearly thirty years
ago, it would have been considered almost indecent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
talk of what future children might turn out&mdash;They
were supposed to come from the cabbage beds and to
have nothing to do with their parents!"</p>

<p>"Of course, one had always heard he was devoted to
you, Seraphim&mdash;He is still."</p>

<p>"Dear Mordryn!&mdash;Laura gave him trouble on the
honeymoon, and once made him look ridiculous&mdash;He
never pardoned that. By the time she was shut up, I
was fifty, G., and had mercifully a strong sense of
humour, so Mordryn and I had no lapses and have remained
firm friends as you know."</p>

<p>"One has often wondered what his inner life could
have been during all those years of horror at home. He
was a model of circumspection outwardly, but the
adoration of women must have affected him now and
then."</p>

<p>"Not greatly, I think&mdash;Naturally he has had some
consolation, but when one thinks of it, it is perfectly
marvellous that no woman in England has ever been
able to flatter herself that she possessed an influence
over him&mdash;and, of course, in these last years he has not
even seen any."</p>

<p>"I suppose he will marry again now, having no heir?"</p>

<p>There was a very interested note in Mr. Strobridge's
voice.</p>

<p>"He must&mdash;And he must find a sane and strong
woman&mdash;the family is on the verge of being overbred.
I must look out a suitable bunch for him to select
from."</p>

<p>"I should leave it to fate this time, Seraphim."</p>

<p>"If I do that some totally unsuitable creature with a
clever mother will grab him."</p>

<p>Mr. Strobridge laughed.</p>

<p>"Has not the man a will of his own?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>"No man has a will of his own while the vanity of
his sex is still in him. He is as defenceless as a baby,
and at the mercy of any cunning female. I could not
bear to see Mordryn suffering a second time," and
Lady Garribardine sighed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After luncheon next day, when the rest of the company
had departed, the Duke stayed on and accompanied
his friend up to her own sitting-room where they
could talk undisturbed.</p>

<p>They understood each other completely. They spoke
for a long time of his travels and of his release at last
from bondage and strain, and of how he was going to
open Valfreyne once more and see the world of his fellows
and take up the thread of his life.</p>

<p>"You must not keep a grain of mawkish sentiment,
Mordryn," Her Ladyship said at last. "You must banish
all remembrance of Laura and Adeliza and begin
life afresh."</p>

<p>"At fifty-three?&mdash;It is a little late, I fear, for the
game to have much zest."</p>

<p>"Tut! tut! You have never found the youngest and
most beautiful woman recalcitrant, I'll wager. One
had heard not so many years ago that a certain fine
creature in Paris almost died of love for you!"</p>

<p>The Duke smiled, and when he did this it was an
illumination, his face in repose was so stern.</p>

<p>"Not of love&mdash;of chagrin, because the ruby in the
bangle she received was reported to her&mdash;by her
masseuse&mdash;to be of less pure pigeon's blood than the
duplicate&mdash;which I gave to the Spaniard. It is impossible
to gauge the love of a mistress; it is equally
kindled by rubies and the charms of a youthful Apollo."</p>

<p>"But you need not now confine your attentions to <i>ces</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
<i>dames</i> any longer, Mordryn; there are numbers of our
world who would console you."</p>

<p>The Duke smiled again.</p>

<p>"None of them ever mattered to me very much, as
you know, dear friend, from the days when my whole
soul was yours. Since then women have been rare relaxations,
ephemeral diversions leaving no mark."</p>

<p>"We are going to change all that!"</p>

<p>Then their talk drifted to other things, and before
His Grace left he had promised to spend Easter at
Blissington.</p>

<p>While luncheon had yet been in full swing and a propitious
moment had come, Gerard had carried out his
plan. The subject of miniatures was introduced, and
a heated argument ensued about the likelihood of the
new acquisitions being by Cosway, and then the suggestion
that the Duke should come in and dine the next
night and decide the matter came out quite naturally.</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine made no remark at the time, and
indeed hardly thought about it, but that night when
she sat by her bedroom fire, she suddenly remembered
that her secretary would meet the Duke, and for a long
time she stared into the glowing embers in deep
thought.</p>

<p>No, it was not possible that the girl had known that
he would speak; that was not her reason for wishing
to go to the House of Lords; but she had seen him
there, and now she would meet him at dinner!</p>

<p>A number of expressions chased themselves over Her
Ladyship's countenance, while her eyes never left the
one point in the coals. The frown of cogitation deepened
on her forehead and then cleared away. She had
come to a decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Mordryn had retired with his hostess after
luncheon, Gerard Strobridge had sought Miss Bush in
the secretary's room.</p>

<p>"The deed is done, Katherine," he announced, with
an attempt at gaiety while his heart was heavy within
him. "The Duke is coming to dinner on Friday night,
and Gwendoline not Arabella, and a couple of bores
from the country, so all my duties and sacrifices
are completed. Now are you going to give me a reward?"</p>

<p>"It depends upon its nature."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that. It is quite a reasonable one. It
is to come down in my motor with me this afternoon
and see the spring borders at Hampton Court?"</p>

<p>Katherine hesitated. She would love to go, but she
had work to do before to-morrow, and unless she sat
up late at night it could not be accomplished.</p>

<p>He came over and spoke earnestly.</p>

<p>"I feel that this will be the last time that we can be
pupil and teacher, Katherine. Fate is going to change
for us both. I want to keep a memory of you, dearest,
when you were my friend alone, without the shadow of
any other interest between&mdash;Won't you try to give me
this one last great pleasure?"</p>

<p>Katherine was touched.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will," she agreed. "I cannot go up and ask
Her Ladyship now, but I believe she would let me go.
I have no business with her until to-morrow morning.
Do you want me to come at once?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will walk on round to the garage and get the
motor, and you can meet me at Stanhope Gate."</p>

<p>It turned out to be an afternoon which neither of
them would ever forget, and Katherine Bush had never
been so near to emotion for her friend as when at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
they sat down upon a bench and looked away to the
broad green avenue between the giant trees.</p>

<p>Gerard Strobridge had exerted every power he
possessed to please her. He had enchanted her fancy,
and had drawn out all that was finest in herself. They
had studied the flowers, and talked of their favourite
books; and Katherine was conscious that she herself
was being brilliant, and that now his flights were not
beyond her, but that she could fully hold her own.</p>

<p>"If I had been unwed, Katherine, would you have
married me?" he asked her at last. "Divine as to-day
has been, think what it would have meant with love between
us&mdash;and further joys to come. Katherine, I
would have done my utmost to make you happy. Will
you answer me this question? I think it may be the
last one I shall ever ask you."</p>

<p>She let her hands fall into her lap and she looked at
him critically for a while before she spoke. And her
voice was reflective when she did reply.</p>

<p>"I think if you had been free at that first Christmas,
yes&mdash;I would have married you, I would have let you
take me away and teach me all that I now know&mdash;And
then I would have made you use all your gifts and rise,
rise to the top of your tree. I would never have rested
until you had reached the summit, and I with you."</p>

<p>He gave a little groan and covered his face with his
hands.</p>

<p>"I forged all the barriers to joy by weakness long
ago, Katherine. I drifted idly down life's stream, and
now am caught in the rushes and cannot get free. The
thought is bitter sweet, dear love&mdash;this picture of what
might have been. And I would have taught you to love
me at last. Ah! God! the pain! But now I do not want
to finish this day with sorrowful repinings. I will keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
this memory of your words and go my way, and when
you come into your kingdom remember me, and let us
renew our friendship on calmer shores."</p>

<p>He took her hand, and pulling her glove off backwards
kissed each white finger, and then his eyes grew
misty and he said farewell. And in Katherine's heart
there was a strange sadness, and they hardly spoke at
all as they sped homewards.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>


<p>When Friday night came and Katherine was
ready to get into the taxi with Miss Gwendoline
d'Estaire, she felt exalted as she had
never done in her life.</p>

<p>This evening would be the test of her powers&mdash;If she
failed, then she would know that such high goals were
not for her, and so she must curtail her aspirations.
<i>But she would not fail.</i> It might be that the Duke
would not be drawn to her&mdash;it was impossible to tell
from that one afternoon what his temperament could
be&mdash;but at all costs she must not fail in being a cultivated
lady, a guest among equals, and so to take at
least that place in his regard.</p>

<p>There was something almost diabolically whimsical
in the fact that one passionate would-be lover was deliberately
arranging that his lady should meet a possible
rival! Gerard Strobridge appreciated this point
as he stood before the cheerful wood fire in the morning-room
in Brook Street, awaiting his guests.</p>

<p>The bores, of course, came first, and then Katherine
and old Miss Gwendoline d'Estaire, and last of all, not
more than five minutes late&mdash;His Grace.</p>

<p>He was quite abnormally distinguished looking in
evening dress, which when dissected did not prove to
be remarkably different from that of the others, but
which yet possessed some subtle quality entirely apart
from theirs, in its bygone suggestion. His manners
were most courtly; he recognised Katherine at once and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
shook hands with her. And then dinner was announced.</p>

<p>Gerard sent the lady bore in with the Duke&mdash;himself
taking old Gwendoline, and leaving Katherine to the
husband, so that Katherine sat next His Grace at a
little round table.</p>

<p>She was looking quite beautiful in a new black frock,
as simple as the old one, and with some of her favourite
lilies of the valley tucked into the belt. Mordryn felt
constrained to talk to his partner until after the fish&mdash;the
host, by a tactful interruption, drew away her attention
and left him free, and then without hesitation
he turned to Katherine.</p>

<p>Her heart was beating fast, and the excitement made
her eyes dark and her cheeks pale, but she did not lose
her head, and indeed felt an extra stimulant to her
brain power.</p>

<p>He began about the debate on Wednesday. The
whole thing was rather a mockery since they were
robbed of all power now in the House of Lords, and
could only make mild protests, but not enforce their
opinions. Was Miss Bush interested in politics?</p>

<p>Katherine said that she was, but thought it rather
a degrading profession now, with paid members making
their living out of their seats. And so they spoke for
a little upon this theme, and the Duke found himself
agreeably entertained. He liked her deep voice, and
above all her extraordinarily good hands.</p>

<p>"Bush?" he said to himself. "I do not remember to
have heard the name before&mdash;the mother perhaps had
the breeding. Those hands do not come from the shrubbery
or the common!"</p>

<p>Now Katherine began to talk of travels. She knew
that all people enjoyed discussing theirs on their return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>She would much like to visit the East. She had always
been thrilled with Kinglake's description of
Damascus in "Eothen." Was it really a city "of hidden
palaces, of copses and gardens, and fountains and
bubbling streams"? His Grace's eyes expressed real
interest now, not so much that they should discuss
Damascus, but that a modern girl should have read
Kinglake and deeply enough to quote him correctly!
He also knew his Kinglake, and had that potent gift
of memory which never stumbles in its manifestations.</p>

<p>He continued the subject with enthusiasm and found
that this charming young woman was familiar with all
the subtlest shades. They had touched upon passages
of peculiar beauty concerning the Dead Sea, and the
girls of Bethlehem and the wonderful desert sun, and
were in the middle of those dedicated to the Sphinx,
when the Duke became aware that a sweet was being
handed and that dinner was more than half over! With
infinite discretion the host had never allowed the flow
of conversation to flag, so that no pause among so
small a company should bring this promising <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>
to a close. Katherine should have a fair field if
he could procure it for her.</p>

<p>But His Grace's good manners reproached him for
his negligence to the lady he had taken in, and he
turned from the contemplation of Katherine's regular
profile with reluctant dutifulness, inwardly determining
to continue Kinglake and other things when they should
all be safely in the drawing-room. These people would
surely play bridge. What a capital thing cards were
if one had strength of mind enough to enforce one's
own selfishness in not playing them!</p>

<p>Katherine now used her best endeavours to be agreeable
to the bore husband, and spoke of subjects which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
were in his ken. And Gerard, watching her, admired
the progress of his pupil. No one of his world, or any
world, could have been a more polished or enchanting
guest. And his pride in her numbed the pain he had
felt all the day.</p>

<p>Then the conversation became general, and gave
fresh opportunity for Katherine to show her powers
of repartee.</p>

<p>Yes, the quartette played bridge, and began it almost
immediately the men joined the ladies upstairs. Mr.
Strobridge had carefully not allowed the talk to stray
to any personal subject while they were alone in the
dining-room, in case the Duke should question him
about Katherine. If so, he would have been forced to
say who she was, and that would spoil her plans perhaps.
How she meant to get out of the dilemma afterwards
he did not speculate. All pretence was so foreign
to her nature. But that was her affair; his only
concern was that this evening should be without flaw.</p>

<p>The Duke found a place on the sofa beside Katherine
as soon as the rest began their rubber, and here he
could look at her undisturbed and without craning his
neck.</p>

<p>He admired her extremely. She was the exact type
which pleased him, distinguished and well-bred looking.
He liked the way she spoke, with no distressingly modern
slang in her phrases. She must evidently have been
most carefully brought up in a really refined home!
Could she be a relation of the d'Estaires? But to ask
questions of this sort was not his method, and he turned
the conversation back to "Eothen" again and kindred
things.</p>

<p>Katherine was in the seventh heaven; she was blooming
like a glowing hot-house plant and seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
radiate sweetness and serenity. Every now and then
she let her eyes meet his dark-blue ones, with that
strange magnetic look in hers which she knew would
compel his interest.</p>

<p>They spoke of music and poetry, and then of pictures&mdash;pictures
in general&mdash;and lastly those of Blissington.</p>

<p>"Did she know Blissington well?"</p>

<p>Yes, she knew it very well, and that enigmatic smile
hovered for a moment round her lips. Mordryn was
surprised at it.</p>

<p>"It contains some recollections for you which are
humorous, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;very humorous."</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me what they are?" His most attractive
clear-cut face came a little nearer to her in his
interest.</p>

<p>"Some day you will know."</p>

<p>"How fraught with meaning! 'Some day I shall
know!' Not to-night, then?"</p>

<p>"No, for to-night we are guests at a dinner-party
and are talking about literature and music and art."</p>

<p>"But I want to talk about you&mdash;May I not?"</p>

<p>"I do not see why you should. I am just a person
whom you will never really see again&mdash;I mean, never
really talk to again&mdash;so why waste time in unprofitable
investigations?"</p>

<p>"How do you know that they would be unprofitable?"</p>

<p>Katherine looked down at her own white hands folded
quietly in her lap, then up again and straight into his
eyes.</p>

<p>"This night week if you chance to think of this evening,
you will realise how right I am as to their complete
unprofitableness!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 383px;">

<img src="images/illus04.jpg" width="383" height="600" alt="" />
<span class="caption">"'You are ready for the great adventure?'"</span>
</div>

<p>"You speak in riddles."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders slightly and smiled.</p>

<p>His Grace found himself distinctly curious.</p>

<p>"Why should you be so sure that I shall never really
see&mdash;or was it speak to&mdash;you again? Do you then live
on some desert island off the north of Scotland, by
chance?"</p>

<p>"In a much more inaccessible place than that." Her
eyes sparkled with some unfathomable expression.</p>

<p>"Iceland?"</p>

<p>"There is an ice barrier surrounding it."</p>

<p>"I shall have to give it up, and you will tell me yourself
out of gratitude, for ceasing to tease you."</p>

<p>Katherine leaned back on the soft green silk cushions
of the sofa. She was looking most alluring in her new
r&ocirc;le of honoured guest. It was so delightful to be perfectly
at ease and able to lean there, and not sit bolt
upright in a chair in an attitude of respect. The Duke
found the sight of her extremely soothing.</p>

<p>"You come to London sometimes, I expect?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for a part of the year."</p>

<p>"Ah! I thought so! I did not believe that Iceland
produced such a polished creature. You know you are
quite unusual, Miss Bush. You have consented, without
apparent reluctance, to talk upon interesting subjects
to a wearied and middle-aged man, and you have
not spoken of golf or dancing&mdash;and you have not
smoked!"</p>

<p>"I do smoke sometimes, but only when I am doing
some tiresome mechanical work like typing."</p>

<p>"Typing?&mdash;I suppose it is useful&mdash;but what can
you have to type? Are you writing a book?"</p>

<p>Katherine gave a sudden soft laugh, infinitely provoking;
it made the blood run in Gerard Strobridge's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
veins, and he viciously played a knave while quivering
with a sense of rebellion. He knew what it meant when
she laughed like that! When would this ghastly evening
end?</p>

<p>And Katherine half whispered: "No, not writing
one, but trying to learn out of that greatest volume of
all time&mdash;the book of life!"</p>

<p>"What can you know of life?" The Duke asked the
question as Gerard Strobridge had asked it long ago.
"Protected and pampered and kept from all but its
pleasant sides&mdash;what can girls of our class know of
life?"</p>

<p>"Tell me, then, what it is&mdash;since I could not be supposed
to know?" and her mouth still looked mischievous
as well as her eyes.</p>

<p>The Duke thrilled a little.</p>

<p>"Life is either a muddle through, or an achievement.
And it contains good things and bad things, and passions&mdash;and
it is forever trying to express itself, and
proclaim its meaning quite regardless of laws."</p>

<p>
"'Tis not to stalk about and draw fresh air,<br />
From time to time, or gaze upon the Sun."<br />
</p>

<p>"Oh! it is a splendid thing!" Katherine cried, and
her voice vibrated. "And unlike the <i>Spanish Student</i>,
I shall not 'grow weary of the bewildering masquerade,'
'where strangers walk as friends and friends as strangers.'
And even if they did, the unexpectedness of it
would be delightful!"</p>

<p>Mordryn looked at her. At the fresh, young firm,
smooth cheeks, the living red, voluptuous mouth, the
ashen-hued hair, every strand of which seemed to be
specially alive and to hold its own silvery glitter. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
then at her strange, compelling eyes, and he sighed a
little. She seemed such an embodiment of vital things.</p>

<p>"You are ready for the great adventure?"</p>

<p>"Quite, and I mean to know everything before I grow
old and indifferent."</p>

<p>He sighed again.</p>

<p>"Age does not always produce indifference; it would
be merciful if it did."</p>

<p>"There can be no need really to grow old. Age
comes because people lose their grip on things."</p>

<p>"Probably. But responsibilities and sorrows and
disappointments age. You have no doubt a very sheltered
life, and so it seems to you that all is easy."</p>

<p>Katherine laughed again softly. It was so delicious
to think of the reality in contrast to his supposition!</p>

<p>"My life is indeed sheltered&mdash;by a very strong shield,
but not by the one your words would suggest."</p>

<p>"No? What then?"</p>

<p>"It is not at all interesting to talk of me; I have
already told you so&mdash;Why do you persist? I would
much rather hear of foreign countries&mdash;Italy, for instance.
I have never been there."</p>

<p>There was not the least subjective deference in her
manner to him. It was as if an equal were talking to
one of her own brain calibre and that equal a woman,
who had a right to be humoured. Women&mdash;especially
girls&mdash;were not wont so to treat him, but were always
more or less impressed by his great position, or his
aloofness, or his satirical but courteous wit. He had
sometimes an expression of contemptuous, amiable
tolerance, which was eighteenth century and disconcerting.
It made all but the most simple or most highly
cultivated among them slightly uneasy&mdash;Was he laughing
at them? They were never quite sure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>He found himself piqued now, and in no mood to be
balked, so he contradicted Katherine.</p>

<p>"You may not find yourself interesting to talk about;
it chances that I do. I wish to know what it is that
shields you so effectively."</p>

<p>"A clear idea of what I want, I expect, and a strong
enough will not to be much buffeted about by any wind
of opinion."</p>

<p>"What a <i>rara avis</i>! And you look so young!"</p>

<p>"I am twenty-three; that is fully grown."</p>

<p>"And what is it you want?"</p>

<p>"To be free to soar&mdash;to see the world&mdash;to feel its
throb&mdash;to demonstrate some of my ideas."</p>

<p>"On what subjects?"</p>

<p>"The meanings of things&mdash;and why they are&mdash;and
the common sense aspect of them. Then one could help
humanity. Lady Garribardine is my ideal of what a
woman should be. There is nothing small about her;
she is as big as a great man and far more sagacious."</p>

<p>"There I am with you!" and his voice became eager.
"Her Ladyship has always been the perfection of things
feminine, in my opinion. You know her well?"</p>

<p>"Extremely well. She is not afraid of her views and
principles. She is really an aristocrat. She believes
in herself, so everyone believes in her, too!"</p>

<p>"Most of us are shaky about ourselves."</p>

<p>"You are not&mdash;I shall turn the tables now and say
I want to talk about you! What does it feel like to
be a Duke?&mdash;A real Duke, not a <i>parvenu</i> or one who
makes a laughing stock of his order."</p>

<p>He smiled; she was a most engaging and audacious
young person, because she did not speak with childish
artlessness, but with deliberation.</p>

<p>"It feels a great responsibility sometimes, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
thing of very little consequence at others. It enforces
perhaps a standard of behaviour which it is difficult
always to follow. If the circumstances of my life had
been different when I was younger, I should have endeavoured
not to let our order slip into impotency;
now the whole modern political outlook disgusts me
so that I seldom speak in the House."</p>

<p>"That is very wrong of you, and cowardly." She
was quite fearless. "You should never give up a fight
or remain passive when what really belongs to you is
being filched from you. If you do, as a band, you deserve
to be put aside. You should fight with the same
fierceness with which those Radicals do who know they
are shams, but are indeed in earnest to obtain their own
ends."</p>

<p>"You are quite right. There are some women who
stimulate in all ways, who are, as it were, sent into
the world as electric dynamos. They get the best out
of everyone; they make men work better and play better&mdash;and
love better."</p>

<p>He looked at her now with his fine eyes sparkling,
but flirtation was far beneath his feet. To his mistresses
he was a master, a generous, tolerant, contemptuous
master; to his friends like Lady Garribardine
the essence of courtly consideration; to the general
company politely aloof. But to the woman who could
arouse his love, what might he not be! Katherine
thought this, and a quiver ran through her of a kind
she had never experienced before, so that her composure
was not so perfect as usual when she answered:</p>

<p>"If one really knew exactly what is love!"</p>

<p>"You have no dim guess at it, then?" He was quite
surprised that it should interest him to know what her
reply would be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I have&mdash;more than that. I know that some
phases of it make one feel mad, agitated, unbalanced,
animal, even motherly and protective&mdash;but what it
could be if it touched the soul, I cannot fathom."</p>

<p>The Duke did not speak for a moment; he was filled
with wonder and a growing admiration, admiration
which extended even beyond the very real appreciation
of her beauty. Her mentality was so far above the
average, her directness so interesting. There was not
the slightest trace of pose in anything she said&mdash;And
that last speech&mdash;what possibilities it opened up! She
knew something of one side of love then, evidently!</p>

<p>"Do you realise what your words imply?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That you have loved someone&mdash;in that way&mdash;once?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have&mdash;It is a way that frightens one, and
makes one more than ever sure that there must be something
else. Do you know that there is&mdash;you who have
lived your life?"</p>

<p>Her face was pale and cool as moonbeams. She
seemed to be talking in the abstract, for all the personal
question. The Duke found himself quite unaccountably
moved, and was just about to answer eagerly, when
at that moment the host joined them from the other
drawing-room; the rubber was over, and he felt he must
do his duty and not make too obvious a point of leaving
the pair alone.</p>

<p>"Come and see the miniatures, Mordryn," he said.
"We must not forget that it was their lure which
brought you here to-night."</p>

<p>His tone Katherine well understood, it contained for
all its surface graciousness some bitterness underneath.</p>

<p>There was general movement after this, and no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
private confidences could be exchanged, so that Miss
d'Estaire and Katherine left, with His Grace's answer
to the latter's question still unspoken.</p>

<p>And Gerard Strobridge, as he pressed Katherine's
hand in good-nights, whispered:</p>

<p>"Have I done well&mdash;and are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>The firm clasp of her cool fingers was his answer.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>


<p>Lady Garribardine was unable to spare her
secretary from the Easter party, so it had been
arranged that she was to have a few days holiday
from the Saturday following the dinner-party,
but she must catch the three o'clock train from Paddington
on the Thursday before Easter, and return
then.</p>

<p>Katherine did not go home to Bindon's Green. She
went off alone to a little place by the sea on the east
coast, and there she set herself to review events, and
think out her plans while she lay upon the sands unheeding
the east wind.</p>

<p>Gerard Strobridge had served her loyally&mdash;the interest
which she had meant to kindle was kindled. The
Duke now had made a mental picture of her, unmarred
by possible qualifications which, if he had known she
was his friend's humble secretary and typist, he would
have been bound to have made. Not that he was in the
least a snob, but that he would have naturally considered
it unbefitting his situation to go about looking
for interesting companions among his friend's dependents.
He would simply not have observed her at all
when he came to Blissington, any more than she herself
had observed either of the footmen at Gerard Strobridge's
dinner. Not that she despised footmen as
footmen, or the Duke secretaries as secretaries; they
were worthy and necessary servants; but guests did not
remark them except in their professional capacities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
people who were there to serve at table or write letters
and attend to business.</p>

<p>Not the slightest irritation or resentment mingled
with these reflections of Katherine's. She was much
too wise and just, and never under the influence of hurt
vanity or dramatic instinct, so this point of view, that
she knew the Duke would naturally take, seemed to her
perfectly right, and instead of resenting it, she had
used her brain to nullify it, knowing full well that if
she played her part at the dinner effectually, interest
would be aroused which no barrier of different statuses
could entirely obliterate afterwards. Now on this last
afternoon at Bayview, she must think out what she
would do next, for the Duke would be arriving at Blissington
by a train from the west which got in a few
minutes after her own from Paddington. She had
known before the dinner-party that he was coming for
Easter, and that morning had received a command from
her mistress that she was to look out for him, and tell
him he was to take the small coup&eacute; and not get into
the other motor, which would await her and be loaded
up with fragile hat-boxes which were coming by Katherine's
train. There would be the luggage car for his
servant and his trunks as well. All the rest of the guests
were arriving by motors or by the express an hour
later.</p>

<p>Thus the plunge from equal to humble secretary
would have to be made at once, and she must see to it
that it was done with tact and skill, so as not to mar
the effect already produced, but rather enhance it.
There was only one drop in her cup. She did not feel
altogether happy in keeping this secret from her beloved
mistress. A secret, too, which concerned her,
perhaps, most valued guest. But it was absolutely impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
that she could frankly avow her intentions to
Lady Garribardine, as she had done to Gerard; so
much she would keep to herself, but she would speak
of her enjoyment at meeting the Duke, if Her Ladyship
did not herself begin the subject, and she had not reason
to believe Mr. Strobridge had told his aunt of the encounter.
She had not seen Lady Garribardine since
the dinner, having left for her holiday very early on
the Saturday morning. All the way down in the train
to Blissington she was conscious of suppressed excitement.
She had been most careful about her appearance,
and looked as charming and yet unobtrusive as
it was possible to look.</p>

<p>She waited, when once arrived, at the entrance where
the subway from the departure platform emerged&mdash;and
she felt a quiver when she saw the top of the Duke's
hat and then his face.</p>

<p>How attractive he looked! And how unlike other
people! Among a crowd he was a magnificent personality,
one to whom porters and officials and strangers
naturally showed deference. Peers could look like
very humble and sometimes even vulgar people, she
knew, but no man, woman or child could mistake
His Grace of Mordryn for anything but a great
noble.</p>

<p>When he caught sight of Katherine standing just
at the inside of the stream of passengers, his whole
stern face changed, and an illuminating smile came over
it, while he stretched out his hand cordially.</p>

<p>"Miss Bush! Are we to be fellow guests? You are
coming to Blissington? How delightful!"</p>

<p>Katherine made as though she did not see the hand,
and with deference and lowered lids, she said:</p>

<p>"Yes, I am going to Blissington, but Your Grace is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
under a misapprehension which I must correct. I am
Her Ladyship's typist and secretary, and I am here
now to give you a message, that you are to take her
Ladyship's own small coup&eacute; and not the motor which
is waiting for the bandboxes and me."</p>

<p>But with all her demureness, she could not prevent
an irresistible and humorous quiver from dimpling
round her lips, and then she raised her steady eyes and
looked at him suddenly as she bowed and moved off
quickly, leaving him for the first time in his life completely
nonplussed! What was the meaning of this
comedy? He felt rather angry. What business had
Gerard Strobridge to trick him so? But had he tricked
him? He recollected now that Miss Bush had not been
mentioned by Gerard at all one way or another. She
was simply treated as any other guest, and had come
apparently with Gwendoline d'Estaire. That she was
a high-bred lady his own senses had told him, whether
she were a typist or no!&mdash;Highly bred and educated
and exceptionally cultivated and refined. She must
certainly be the daughter of some friend of Sarah's who
had met with financial misfortune, poor charming girl!
And he hurried after her&mdash;but only got outside the
station to see her disappear in a motor already piled
up inside with milliner's boxes. So, baffled and still
deeply interested, he entered the coup&eacute; awaiting him
and was whirled off. Seraphim would, of course, tell
him all about it, and so he dismissed the matter from
his mind; but his first thought when he got into the hall
was to wonder if Katherine would be at tea. She was
not. Tea was a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> affair in his old friend's
boudoir, where a hundred thousand things of interest
had to be discussed between them, and no time or chance
was given for reference to obscure secretaries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>After tea on her way down to receive the guests,
who would continue to arrive in relays until dressing
time, Lady Garribardine went into the schoolroom to
see Katherine.</p>

<p>They spoke of business, and Katherine received
orders, and took down notes, and then she said:</p>

<p>"Your Ladyship will be amused to hear that I met
the Duke at dinner at Mr. Strobridge's. He did not
know my position, and I am afraid at the time I did
not undeceive him. It was such a very great pleasure
to me to be taken for a lady and a guest just for once.
Of course, I told him at the station my real position,
and he appeared much surprised."</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine walked to the window and pretended
to be looking out at something. She wanted to
hide all the expression which might come into her eyes.
The simple words, "It was such a very great pleasure
to be taken for a lady and a guest just for once," had
deeply touched her. She seemed to realise what such a
spirit as Katherine's must feel, always in a subordinate
position of no particular status&mdash;And with what
dignity she carried it off!</p>

<p>"Child," she answered, without looking round, "no
one who knows you would ever take you for anything
else&mdash;the theory of blood being absolutely necessary
for this, you have proved to be nonsense. The Duke
is one of my oldest friends and a very fine gentleman.
I am glad you had a chance of talking freely to him."</p>

<p>After she had left the room, Katherine folded and
unfolded a bit of paper, a very unusual agitation moving
her.</p>

<p>"Oh! I wish I could tell her outright, my dear
lady!" she cried to herself. "I almost believe she would
sympathise with me, but if I see that she would not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
and that it would hurt and anger her, I will give up
even this, my ambition."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Gerard Strobridge was not of this party; he had
been obliged to go to his brother's, so Katherine would
have no collaborator and would be forced to act alone.</p>

<p>She did not dine downstairs, but was required in the
drawing-room afterwards, and until ten o'clock she
stayed alone in her sitting-room, wondering what the
Duke had thought, and if it would have been wiser to
have stayed for a minute after firing her bomb.</p>

<p>Had she known it, nothing to chain his interest could
have been better than her swift disappearance, for he
was now thinking of her, and at the first opportunity
between the soup and fish, he said to his hostess:</p>

<p>"Seraphim, I met your secretary, it seems, the other
night at Gerard's&mdash;a very intelligent girl. I had no
idea at the time that she was in any dependent position&mdash;and
was greatly surprised when she addressed me at
the station to-day as 'Your Grace'! She is some misfortunate
friend's daughter, I suppose. Anyone I
knew?"</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine's eyes beamed with a momentary
twinkle which she suppressed&mdash;She thought of the auctioneer
father and the butcher grandfather and then
she said casually:</p>

<p>"No&mdash;she came from an advertisement, but she is a
splendid creature, with more sense in her little finger
than most of us have in our entire bodies&mdash;What do
you think of my grey locks, Mordryn?"</p>

<p>The Duke assured her he found them bewitching;
he saw that she did not mean to speak of her secretary.</p>

<p>"They cause you to look ten years younger, dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
friend. I could find it in my heart to make love to you
once more&mdash;and be repulsed with unabated violence, I
fear!"</p>

<p>"Love was good when we were young, Mordryn; ten
or twelve years do not matter when a man is twenty-five
and a woman thirty-five to thirty-eight&mdash;that is,
if they are not married. The discrepancy in age only
becomes grotesque later. We loved and laughed and
lived then, and should be grateful&mdash;I am&mdash;As for you,
you will love again&mdash;fifty-three for a man is nothing.
You are abominably attractive, you know, Mordryn,
with your weary, aloof air&mdash;and your Dukedom&mdash;And
now that you are altogether free from anxieties, you
should take the cup of joy in both hands and quaff it&mdash;Look
round the table. Have I not provided some sweet
creatures for you?"</p>

<p>"You have indeed&mdash;Which one in particular have
you destined for the cup-bearer?"</p>

<p>"Any one of the three on that side towards the top.
You can't have brains and beauty. Lily Trevelyan
has beauty, and enough tact to hide her absence of
brain. Blanche Montague has no beauty but a certain
chic&mdash;and I am told wonderful variety of talent. She
does not satiate her admirers with sameness&mdash;While
Julia Scarrisbrooke is all passion so well assumed as to
be better than the real article, and always handy. These
credentials I have collected from a cohort of past admirers
and they can be vouched for. You have only
to choose. Any one of them will be enchanted. They
are only waiting to spring into your arms!"</p>

<p>"I believe that would bore me. I want someone who
is not enchanted&mdash;someone who leaves the whole initiative
to me."</p>

<p>Her Ladyship cast up her eyes. "My dear Mordryn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
your unsophistication pains me! Who ever heard of a
Duke of fifty-three, well preserved, good-looking, unmarried
and distinguished&mdash;known to be generous as
a lover and full of charm&mdash;being allowed to take the
initiative with women&mdash;Fie!"</p>

<p>The Duke laughed, and by some curious turn of
fancy he seemed to see the white, perfectly composed
face of the stately, slender secretary, who had treated
him as naught that night at Gerard's, and then looked
almost mockingly respectful when she called him "Your
Grace!" in the station. Would she be in the drawing-room
after dinner?&mdash;Perhaps.</p>

<p>Yes, she was, over by the piano at the far end; but
Lily Trevelyan and Blanche Montague and Julia Scarrisbrooke
had surrounded him before he could get half-way
down the long room, and escape was out of the
question. No man&oelig;uvring enabled him to break free
of them. So he had to sit and be purred at, and see
with the tail of his eye a graceful creature in black
talking quietly (and intelligently he felt sure) to some
less important guest&mdash;and then playing accompaniments&mdash;and
then slipping away through a door at that
end, presumably to bed.</p>

<p>He cursed civilisation, he profoundly cursed beautiful
ladies, and he became sarcastic and caused Julia
and Lily who were for the moment bosom friends to
confide to each other, over the latter's bedroom fire,
that Mordryn was "too darling for words" but spiteful
as Her Ladyship's black cat.</p>

<p>"I do hate men to be so clever&mdash;don't you, Lil?
One never knows where one is, with them."</p>

<p>"Oh! but Ju, dearest, he isn't deformed or deadly
dull or diseased, or tipsy, he is awfully good looking
and very rich and <i>a Duke</i>&mdash;Really you can't have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
everything. I thought Blanche Montague was shockingly
open in her desire to secure him, did not you? I
wonder why Sarah asked her here with us!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile Katherine Bush did not permit herself to
wonder at His Grace's possible feelings or his future
actions at all. She had seen the eager look in his dark
blue eyes once or twice across the room and being a
wise woman left things to fate.</p>

<p>"I wish G. were here," the hostess said to herself as
she, too, stood by a bedroom fire&mdash;her own. "I have
no one to exchange unspoken confidence with. He would
have understood and appreciated the enchanting
comedy of female purpose, male instinct to flee, and one
young woman's supreme intelligence!"</p>

<p>The next day the Duke, who knew the house well,
and in what wing Miss Arnott had worked, took it into
his head to walk before breakfast in the rose garden.
Miss Bush saw him from the window and allowed herself
to bow gravely when he deliberately looked up;
then she moved away. He felt a distinct sensation of
tantalization. After breakfast everyone would play
tennis. He played an extraordinarily good game himself,
and was in flannels ready. Katherine thought he
had a very fine figure and looked much younger in those
clothes. She wanted to ask him about the emerald ring&mdash;she
wanted to ask him about a number of things.
She had work to do all the morning, but came out
to the tennis lawn with a message to her mistress just
before luncheon, during an exciting single match between
the Duke and an agile young man&mdash;the last game
was at 30 all&mdash;and Katherine paused to watch the
strokes&mdash;40-30&mdash;And then Mordryn won&mdash;amidst
shouts of applause.</p>

<p>Katherine had remarked that he ran about very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
little and won by sheer style and skill and hard hitting.</p>

<p>She did not loiter a second when he was free to move,
but flitted back to the house before he could get near
her.</p>

<p>She lunched alone in her schoolroom.</p>

<p>By the afternoon, when she did appear at tea, the
Duke was thoroughly ill-tempered, he knew not why
or for what reason, merely that his mood was so. Katherine,
busy with the teapot, only raised her head to
give a polite, respectful bow in answer to his greeting.
He was infinitely too much a man of the world to single
out the humble secretary and draw upon her the wrath
of these lovely guests. So he contented himself by
watching her, and noting her unconcerned air and easy
grace. Some of the people seemed to know her well
and be very friendly with her.</p>

<p>She showed not the slightest sign of a desire to speak
to him&mdash;Could it be possible that this was the girl who
only that night week had talked with him upon the
enthralling subject of love!</p>

<p>Those utterances of hers which had sounded so
cryptic at the time were intelligible now. How subtle
had been her comprehension of the situation. He remembered
her face when he had asked her if she knew
Blissington! And again when she had told him that
that night week he would know how altogether unprofitable
any investigations regarding her would be! And
now in the character of humble secretary she was just as
complete as she had been when apparently a fellow
guest and social equal. It was all annoyingly disturbing.
It placed him in a false position and her in one in
which she held all the advantages! And there she sat
serene and dignified, hedged round with that barrier of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
ice of which she had spoken. He had not experienced
such perplexing emotions for many years.</p>

<p>He wanted to talk to her. He wanted to ask her
what it all meant&mdash;He would like to know her history,
and whence she had come. Gwendoline d'Estaire had
treated her, he had noticed, not as a dependent, but as
a friend. He felt himself rather awkward&mdash;he, a man
of the world accustomed to homage from women!</p>

<p>He did manage to say that it was a bore that the
rain had come on, and it looked as though to-morrow
would be wet. And he felt humiliated at the fine, instantly
suppressed smile which flickered round her
mouth at this brilliant remark from an acknowledged
wit!</p>

<p>Then he became angry with himself&mdash;what matter to
him whether she smiled or did not smile? It was obvious
that he could not be on terms of familiar friendship
with Seraphim's secretary, at his age and with his
position. So he had strength of mind to move away
from the table, and to allow himself to be purred over
by one of the trio of charmers who had been asked for
his benefit&mdash;but rage mounted in his breast. He was
not enjoying himself at all, and if he did not see more
of his old friend herself, he really would not stay over
Monday as he had intended, but would go back to town
on Sunday night!</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine knew the signs of the times and
took him off to her sitting-room after tea when most
of the others began to play bridge.</p>

<p>"I think modern women have less charm than they
had, Seraphim," the Duke said from the depths of an
armchair, rather acidly. "They are almost as illiterate
as ladies of the ballet used to be when I was young;
they are quite as slangy and noisy, and they are full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
of affectations. If one does not know the last word
of their fashionable jargon and cannot keep up a constant
flow of 'back talk'&mdash;which, incidentally, it would
require the wit of the St. James Street cabmen of
twenty years ago to be able to do&mdash;one is asphyxiated
by them. I shall have to become acclimated, I feel. I
have been too long away and have lost touch with the
movement&mdash;I sigh for repose and peace."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Mordryn&mdash;it will do you a great deal of
good to be shaken up, you must move with the times."</p>

<p>"But I entirely decline to do so. To what end?"</p>

<p>"You must certainly marry again now that you are
at last free."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly it is my obvious duty, as otherwise
the title will die out&mdash;but surely you do not suggest
that I should convert any of these charming creatures
who were good enough to try to lighten my mood last
night and to-day, into my wife! I had hoped they were
at least safely married, and now you make me tremble
in case you are going to announce to me that some are
widows!"</p>

<p>"Blanche Montague is; I merely asked the others to
accustom you to the modern type. They are to break
in your sensibilities, so to speak, and next time you
come, if you don't fancy Blanche I will have a selection
of suitable prospective Duchesses."</p>

<p>"Will they make as much noise as these '<i>ballons
d'essai</i>'?"</p>

<p>"More&mdash;nothing modern can be dignified or quiet,
so get the idea out of your head. They are all so out
of door and so hearty, such delightful, fresh, knowing,
supremely uninnocent, jolly good fellows, they can't
be silent or keep still. There are too many new <i>r&eacute;vues</i>
to be talked about, and too much golf to be played,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
and new American nigger dances to be learned.&mdash;Come,
come, Mordryn! You do not want to be ridiculously
old-fashioned&mdash;and really Blanche Montague is most
suitable. Montague left her well provided for&mdash;and
she was only thirty-two last birthday."</p>

<p>"But I don't like her voice, and what should we converse
about in the <i>entr'actes</i>?"</p>

<p>"Blanche is famous for her small talk, she will start
upon any subject under the sun you please&mdash;and
change it before you can answer the first question. No
fear of stagnation there!"</p>

<p>"Even the description tires me. I prefer the lady
who you assured me was all simulated passion. I adore
passion, though I confess I prefer it to be real."</p>

<p>"How captious of you! The thing is unknown in
these days, it has to be reconstructed, like the modern
rubies&mdash;lots of little ground-up fragments pressed into
a whole by scientific chemistry.&mdash;A good imitation is
all you will get, Mordryn."</p>

<p>"I loathe imitations," and His Grace shuddered.</p>

<p>"I think you had better give me an exact description
of what you do want, for, my poor old friend, you seem
to be out to court disappointment. I earnestly desire
to help you into a second noose more satisfactory than
the one I originally placed around your neck&mdash;so out
with it! A full description!"</p>

<p>The Duke deliberately lit a cigarette, and a gleam
of firelight caught his emerald ring.</p>

<p>"Your famous talisman is flashing, Mordryn, the
lyre shows that it approves of your thoughts!"</p>

<p>"The woman I should like to marry must be, and
look&mdash;supremely well-bred&mdash;but healthy and normal,
not overbred like poor Laura, and Gerard's wife,
Beatrice.&mdash;She must be able to talk upon the subjects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
which interest one&mdash;a person of cultivation in short.
She must have a sense of humour and fine ideals and a
strong feeling about the responsibilities of the position,
and be above all things dignified and quiet and composed.&mdash;And
I should like&mdash;" and here a faint deprecatory
smile flickered about his mouth for a moment,
"I should like her to love me, and take a little interest
in the human, tangible side of the affair&mdash;if you do not
think I am asking too much of fate at my age?"</p>

<p>"It is a large order&mdash;I only know of one woman who
answers to your requirements and she of course is entirely
out of the question."</p>

<p>"Who is she&mdash;and why is she out of the question?"</p>

<p>"Useless to answer either query, since, as I say, she
is altogether out of the running. It was only an idea
of mine, but I will diligently seek for your paragon&mdash;for,
Mordryn, I shall never feel my conscience clear
until I see you happily told off&mdash;and the father of at
least six sturdy boys."</p>

<p>The Duke raised his hands in deprecation.</p>

<p>"Heavens, Seraphim! You would overwhelm me with
a litter, then! My wants in that direction are modest.
The 'quiver full' has never appealed to me. I want
my wife to be my loved companion&mdash;my darling if you
will&mdash;but not, not a rabbit."</p>

<p>When he was dressing for dinner he thought over his
friend's words&mdash;He had not insisted upon knowing who
the "one woman" could be&mdash;He himself had lately seen
a creature who seemingly, as far as he could judge
from one evening's acquaintance, possessed quite a number
of the necessary qualifications&mdash;but as in the case
of Seraphim's specimen, his was also completely out
of the running, and not to be thought of in any capacity&mdash;Alas!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>It was strange, with this resolution so firmly fixed
in his mind, that after dinner he should have broken
loose from the bevy of ladies waiting to entrap him,
and have deliberately gone to the piano to talk to that
dull little Lady Flamborough who was leaning upon
the lid, chatting with Miss Bush!</p>

<p>Katherine kept her eyes fixed upon the keyboard with
that meek, deferential demureness suitable to her station
when amidst such exalted company; but her red
mouth had an indefinable expression about it which was
exasperating.</p>

<p>Mordryn seized the first second in which Lady Flamborough's
attention was diverted by a remark from
someone else, to bend down a little and say softly,</p>

<p>"Are you not even going to say good evening to me,
Miss Bush?&mdash;It is 'this night week.'"</p>

<p>She looked up with perfect composure.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Your Grace."</p>

<p>He frowned. "Is that all?"</p>

<p>"As Your Grace very truly remarked, it is 'this night
week.'"</p>

<p>"And you think that has answered all the riddles?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>He frowned again, he knew Julia Scarrisbrooke was
swooping down upon him, there was not a moment's
time to be lost.</p>

<p>"I do not&mdash;to-morrow I will make an opportunity in
which you will have to answer them all categorically&mdash;do
you hear?"</p>

<p>Katherine thrilled. She liked his haughty bearing,
the tone of command in his perfect voice.</p>

<p>She remembered once when she and Matilda had been
eating lunch at a Lyons popular caf&eacute;, Matilda had
said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>"My! Kitten, there's such a strange-looking young
man sitting behind you&mdash;Whatever makes him look
quite different to everyone else?"</p>

<p>And she had turned and perceived that a pure Greek
Hermes in rather shabby modern American clothes was
manipulating a toothpick within a few feet of her&mdash;and
her eye, trained from museum study, had instantly seen
that it was the balance of proportion, the set and size
of the head, and the angle of placing of eyes which differentiated
him so startlingly from the mass of
humanity surrounding them. She had said to Matilda:</p>

<p>"You had better look at him well, Tild&mdash;You will
never see such another in the whole of your life. He
is a freak, a perfect survival of the ancient Greek type.
He is exactly right and not strange-looking really. It
is all the other people who are wrong and clumsy or
grotesque."</p>

<p>She thought of this now. The Duke stood out from
everyone else in the same way, although he was not
of pure Greek type, but much more Roman, but there
was that astonishing proportion of bone and length of
limb about him, the acknowledged yet indescribable
shape of a thoroughbred, which middle age had not diminished,
but rather accentuated.</p>

<p>She again noticed his hands, and his great emerald
ring&mdash;but she did not reply at all to his announcement
of his intentions for the morrow. She bent down
and picked up a piece of music which had fallen to the
floor, and Julia Scarrisbrooke swooped and caught her
prey and carried it off into safety on a big sofa.</p>

<p>But as Katherine gazed from her window on that
Good Friday night up into the deep blue star-studded
sky, a feeling of awe came over her&mdash;at the magnitude
of the vista fate was opening in front of her eyes.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>


<p>The Duke found great difficulty in carrying out
his intention on that Saturday. For a Duke to
escape from a lady-pack brought there especially
to hunt him is no easy task! He had reason to
believe that his hostess would not aid him either, and
that it would be impossible to appeal to her sympathy,
because he was quite aware that he would withhold his
own, had he to look at the matter dispassionately as
concerning someone else.</p>

<p>It was a fool's errand he was bent upon in all senses
of the phrase. But as this conviction forced itself upon
him, the desire to see and talk with Katherine grew
stronger.</p>

<p>It happened that she lunched downstairs. At such
a large party as this, that meal was consumed at several
small tables of six each, and of course the secretary
was not placed at His Grace's! Indeed, she sat
at one directly at his back, so that he could not
see her, though once in a pause he heard her deep, fascinating
voice. When later in the hall coffee and
cigarettes had come, Katherine passed near him to put
down a cup, and he seized the moment to address
her.</p>

<p>"In twenty minutes, I am coming from the smoking-room
to the schoolroom&mdash;please be there."</p>

<p>Miss Bush gave no sign as to whether or no she heard
this remark, which was made in a low voice with a note
of pleading in it. If he chose to do this, she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
make it quite clear that she would have no clandestine
acquaintance with him, but at the same time she experienced
a delicious sense of excitement.</p>

<p>She was seated before her typewriter busily typing
innumerable letters, when she heard his footsteps outside,
and then a gentle tap at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in!" she called, and he appeared.</p>

<p>His face looked stern, and not particularly good-tempered.</p>

<p>"May I stay for a moment in this haven of rest,
Miss Bush?" and he shut the door. "In so large a
party, every sitting-room seems to be overflowing, and
there is not a corner where one may talk in peace."</p>

<p>Katherine had risen with her almost overrespectful
air, which never concealed the mischievous twinkle in
her eyes when she raised them, but now they were fixed
upon the sheets of paper.</p>

<p>"Your Grace is welcome to that armchair for a little,
but I am very occupied. Lady Garribardine wishes
these letters to go by this evening's post."</p>

<p>"I wish you would not call me 'Your Grace'," he
said, a little impatiently. "I cannot realise that you
can be the same person whom I met at Gerard Strobridge's."</p>

<p>"I am not," she looked up at him.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"It is obvious&mdash;I was me&mdash;myself, that night&mdash;a
guest."</p>

<p>"And now?"</p>

<p>"Your Grace is not observant, I fear; I am Her
Ladyship's secretary."</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;but still?" he came over quite close to
her.</p>

<p>"If I had been the same person as the one you met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
at Mr. Strobridge's, you would not now have been
obliged to contrive to come to the schoolroom to speak
to me."</p>

<p>A dark flush mounted to his brow. She had touched
a number of his refined sensibilities. Her words were so
true and so simple, and her tone was quite calm, showing
no personal emotion but merely as though she were
announcing a fact.</p>

<p>"That is unfortunately true, but these are only
ridiculous conventions, which please let us brush aside.
May I really sit down for a minute?"</p>

<p>Katherine glanced at the clock; it was half-past
three.</p>

<p>"Until a quarter to four, if you wish. I am afraid I
cannot spare more time than that."</p>

<p>She pointed to the armchair which he took, and she
reseated herself at the table, folding her hands. There
was a moment's silence. The Duke was feeling uncomfortably
disturbed. There had been a subtle rebuke
conveyed in her late speech, which he knew he merited.
He had no right to have come there.</p>

<p>"Are you not going to talk to me at all, then?" he
almost blurted out.</p>

<p>"I will answer, of course, when Your Grace speaks;
it is not for me to begin."</p>

<p>"Very well, I not only speak&mdash;I implore&mdash;I even
order you to discontinue this ridiculous humility, this
ridiculous continuance of 'Your Grace,' resume the character
of guest, and let us enjoy these miserable fifteen
minutes&mdash;but first, I want to know what is the necessity
for your total change of manner here? Gerard and
Gwendoline knew that you were Lady Garribardine's
secretary that night, but they did not consider it imperative
to make a startling difference in their rela<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>tions
towards you because of that, as it seems that you
would wish me to make now."</p>

<p>Katherine looked down and then up again straight
into his eyes, a slight smile quivered round her mouth.</p>

<p>"That is quite different&mdash;they know me very well&mdash;and
dear Miss Gwendoline is not very intelligent. I
have been there before to help to entertain bores for
Mr. Strobridge and Lady Beatrice, but that night I
was there&mdash;because I wanted to see&mdash;Your Grace."</p>

<p>Here she looked down again suddenly. The Duke
leaned forward eagerly; this was a strange confession!</p>

<p>"I wanted once to talk to a man as an equal, to feel
what it was like to be a lady and not to have to remember
to be respectful. So I deliberately asked Mr. Strobridge
to arrange it&mdash;after I had heard you speak."</p>

<p>The Duke was much astonished&mdash;and gratified.</p>

<p>"How frank and delicious of you to tell me this! I
thought the evening was enchanting&mdash;but why do you
say such a silly thing as that you wanted to feel what
it was like to be a lady? You could never have felt
anything else."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I could; I am not a lady by birth, anything
but! only I have tried to educate myself into being one,
and it was so nice to have a chance of deciding if I had
succeeded or no."</p>

<p>"And your verdict was?" he raised amused eyebrows.</p>

<p>She looked demure.</p>

<p>"By Your Grace's words just now, I conclude that
I have succeeded."</p>

<p>"Only by my words just now? I thought we had
had a rather pleasant and interesting hour of conversation
as fellow-guests."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;You are not shocked, then, when I tell you
that I am not really a lady?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. The counterfeit presentment is so very perfect,
one would like to hear the details of the passage
to its achievement."</p>

<p>Then she told him in as few and as simple words as
she could&mdash;just the truth. Of her parentage, of her
home at Bindon's Green&mdash;of Liv and Dev's, of her
ideals, and her self-education, and of her coming to
Lady Garribardine's.</p>

<p>Mordryn listened with rapt attention, his gaze fixed
upon her face&mdash;he made brief ejaculations at times,
but did not otherwise interrupt her.</p>

<p>"You can understand now how entertained I was at
the things which you said to me that night, can you
not?"</p>

<p>Thus she ended her story, and the Duke rose and
sat down upon the edge of the table quite close to her;
he was visibly moved.</p>

<p>"You extraordinary girl. You have upset every
theory I ever held. I shall go away now and think over
all you have said&mdash;Meanwhile, I feel that this is the
only way in which I can show my homage," and he took
her hand with infinite respect and kissed it.</p>

<p>Then he removed his tall form from the table and
quietly left the room.</p>

<p>And when she was alone, Katherine gently touched
the spot where his lips had pressed; there was a quite
unknown emotion running through her.</p>

<p>She found it very difficult to go on with her work
after this, and made a couple of mistakes, to her
great annoyance. Nearly an hour passed. She got
up from her typing, and after changing her blouse,
went down to tea, her thoughts not nearly so calm as
usual.</p>

<p>Was her friendship with this man finished? Had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
her frankness overreached itself? Just what did that
kiss mean? Here was a character not so easy to read
as Gerard Strobridge's. Here was a will perhaps as
strong as her own. Her face was very pale, and those
concentrated grey-green eyes looked stormy and resentful.</p>

<p>The Duke reached the smoking-room and was seated
at the writing-table only one moment before the room
was invaded by Lady Garribardine.</p>

<p>"Poor Mordryn! You had to take refuge here! I
fear those charming creatures I have invited for you
are proving a little fatiguing."</p>

<p>"Frankly, Seraphim, they bore me to death."</p>

<p>"Two others are coming of a different type presently.
But you are safe in this corner. Most of them
do not know I have moved the smoking-room to this
wing."</p>

<p>"I think it is a great improvement."</p>

<p>Her Ladyship looked at him out of the tail of her
eye, but she said, quite innocently:</p>

<p>"Yes, Gerard always says so." Then she left him to
his letters, with a word as to tea and a cosy talk in
her boudoir after it.</p>

<p>So Gerard liked this room, too! Miss Bush was with
him at the House. She dined at Brook Street. Then
Mordryn frowned and looked the very image of the Iron
Duke, and did not even begin to write an order which
he had intended to send his agent. His mind was disturbed.
Every word Katherine had said had made a
deep impression upon him.</p>

<p>The father an auctioneer&mdash;the grandfather a butcher!
And this girl a peerless creature fit for a throne!
But if she were fit for heaven, there were still quite insurmountable
barriers between even ordinary acquaint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>ance
with her. He rather thought he would leave Blissington
on Sunday night.</p>

<p>Then he frowned again. Gerard Strobridge was a
charming fellow. Seraphim adored him&mdash;he was often
here&mdash;he liked the smoking-room! Somehow the conversation
must be turned, when he was alone with his
friend presently, to the subject of Gerard.</p>

<p>Then he found himself going over every minute sentence
that had fallen from Katherine. What a wonderful,
wonderful girl! How quite ridiculous class
prejudices were! How totally faulty the reasoning of
the world!</p>

<p>At tea, he did not converse with Miss Bush, but he
never lost the consciousness of her presence, and was
almost annoyedly aware of a youngish man's evident
appreciation of her conversation. So that his temper,
when he found himself in Lady Garribardine's sitting-room,
was even more peevish than it had been on the
evening before.</p>

<p>Katherine had preceded him there, but had left ere
he arrived. She had brought some letters for her mistress'
inspection. When this business was finished, she
said quite simply:</p>

<p>"His Grace came up into the schoolroom after
luncheon to-day. He appears to have been confused
over my two identities. I explained to him, and told
him who my father was, and my mother's father, and
how I have only tried to make myself into a lady. It
did not seem fair that he should think that I was really
one born."</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine looked disagreeable for an instant.
She, too, had to conquer instinct at times, which
asserted itself in opposition even to her heart's desire,
and her deliberate thought-out intentions. One of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
ancestors had put a retainer in chains for presumption!
But her intelligence crushed out the folly almost as
quickly as it arose, and she smiled:</p>

<p>"And, of course, the Duke at once said he could not
know common people, and bounced from the room!
Katherine Bush, you are a minx, my child!"</p>

<p>Katherine laughed softly.</p>

<p>"He did not say that exactly&mdash;but he did go away
very soon."</p>

<p>"'He that fights and runs away!'" quoth Her Ladyship;
"but I don't think you had better let him come
to the schoolroom again. Martha will be having her
say about the matter."</p>

<p>Katherine reddened. That her dear mistress should
think her so stupid!</p>

<p>"I did not intend to. It is very difficult&mdash;even the
greatest gentlemen do not seem to know their places
always."</p>

<p>"A man finds his place near the woman he wants to
talk to&mdash;you must not forget that, girl!"</p>

<p>"It is a little mean and puts the woman in a false
position often."</p>

<p>"She prefers that to indifference. There is one very
curious thing about women, the greatest prude is not
altogether inwardly displeased at the knowledge that
she exercises a physical attraction for men. Just as
the greatest intellectual among men feels more flattered
if exceptional virility is imputed to him, than all the
spiritual gifts! Virility&mdash;a quality which he shares
with the lower animals, spirituality a gift which he inherits
from God. Oh! we are a mass of incongruities,
we humans! and brutal nature eventually wins the game.
Animal savagery is always the outcome of too
much civilisation. And unless the dark ages of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
ignorance fall upon us once more, so that we can again
be sufficiently simple to believe <i>en masse</i> in a God, I
feel our cycle is over and that we shall be burnt out of
time."</p>

<p>Then presently, as her secretary was moving towards
the door, Her Ladyship remarked irrelevantly:</p>

<p>"Look here, girl&mdash;Do you think it is in your nature
ever to love really, or are you going to let brain
conquer always?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;do not know," faltered Katherine.</p>

<p>"Love is the only thing on earth which is sublime.
This evening until you come down after dinner, I recommend
you to read the 'Letters of Abelard and Heloise'."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Duke talked of politics for a while when he came
into his old love's sitting-room&mdash;and then of books and
ideas, and lastly of Gerard. Was he happy with Beatrice,
after all?</p>

<p>"Yes, they do very well together. Beatrice is bred
out of all natural emotions. She is sexless and well-mannered
and unconsciously humorous. They go their
own ways."</p>

<p>"But Gerard was always an ardent lover. Has he
had no emotions since the Alice Southerwood days?"</p>

<p>"A transient passion for L&auml;o Delemar, and since
then a deep devotion elsewhere&mdash;quite unreturned,
though. It has rather improved him."</p>

<p>The Duke unconsciously felt relief.</p>

<p>"Unreturned?&mdash;that must be a new experience for
him: Gerard has every quality to attract a woman."</p>

<p>"This one is infinitely too proud and too intelligent
to waste a thought upon a married man."</p>

<p>"It is a girl, then! How unlike Gerard's usual
taste!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Mordryn, shall you open Valfreyne quite
soon?"</p>

<p>"Immediately&mdash;I shall have a party for Whitsuntide,
if you will honour me by acting hostess."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;if I may bring my <i>personnel</i> with me&mdash;a
large order! I can't stand the racket without Stirling
and James and Harmon, my chauffeur&mdash;and Miss
Bush."</p>

<p>"All are perfectly welcome&mdash;especially Miss Bush.
She appeared an extremely clever girl when I had the
pleasure of talking to her."</p>

<p>"Yes, she is a wonderful creature. I am thinking of
marrying her off to Sir John Townly."</p>

<p>The Duke leaned forward, his voice was quite
shocked.</p>

<p>"How inhuman, Seraphim! John Townly must be
sixty, at least."</p>

<p>"My dear Mordryn, that is only seven years older
than you are, and I look upon you as hardly yet at the
prime of life&mdash;and beggars cannot be choosers, the girl
is of no family. Neither for that matter is Sir John.
It will be suitable in every way&mdash;&mdash;I suppose you will
let me have a say as to the guests for the Whitsuntide
outbreak, eh?"</p>

<p>"Naturally&mdash;but spare me any too overmodern widows,
or any further breakers in of my sensibilities!"</p>

<p>Seraphim laughed, and they set about making the
list.</p>

<p>But when the Duke had gone to dress, she looked long
into the fire, something a little sentimental and yet satisfied
in her gaze.</p>

<p>"Dear Mordryn&mdash;Gerard and the smoking-room
caused him uneasiness; it would not have done for that
to continue, because of the unpleasant reflection that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
G. is a married man. Sir John was splendid&mdash;but Mordryn
is no fool. I must now really oppose him in every
possible way&mdash;&mdash;I am not sure if, after all, I shall
take her to Valfreyne."</p>

<p>And the Duke, as he dressed, said to himself that he
did not understand women. Here was Seraphim, a
creature with the kindest heart, yet so full of that distressingly
feminine matchmaking instinct which was the
curse of her sex, that she was ready to pitchfork this
charming, living, fascinating young person into the
mouldering arms of old John Townly! The idea was
simply revolting to contemplate, even if beggars could
not be choosers! And then suddenly he seemed to see
the auctioneer father and the butcher grandfather and
the home at Bindon's Green!</p>

<p>He walked down to dinner in a subdued mood.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>


<p>On Easter Sunday in church, Katherine sat in the
overflow pew, and so could be looked at by those
highly placed in the chancel seat of honour
without the least turning of their heads. It was not
surprising, then, that the Duke found the sermon a
very good, and a very short one, as his thoughts ran
on just as Gerard Strobridge's had done in that same
church once before.</p>

<p>What a charming oval face the girl had&mdash;and how
purely white was her skin! What was she thinking
about with that inscrutable expression? The mouth
was so firm and so was the chin. Full red lips, which
were yet firm, were dangerous things. Her air was very
distinguished and her garments showed great taste.
The whole thing was incredible, of course; there must
be some harking back to gentle blood. Not one of
the party looked so like his ideal of a lady as she.</p>

<p>And she had spoken, too, of love! She had admitted
that she knew of one side of it. What were her words,
"It makes one feel mad&mdash;agitated, unbalanced, animal,
even motherly and protective," but what it could be if
it touched the soul she could not fathom&mdash;&mdash;Well,
the phase which she did know was not without its
charm! What extraordinary, alluring eyes she had!
Who could the fellow have been? Not a person from&mdash;er&mdash;Bindon's
Green, of course; she must always have
been too refined for that&mdash;and not Gerard. A woman
who had once felt those emotions for a man did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
look at him with that serene calm with which Miss Bush
had looked at Gerard. What a most damnably
exasperating circumstance it was that she was not a
guest&mdash;and that he could not spend the afternoon
discussing love, and its aspects, while pacing that
sunny walk in the walled garden, safe from the east
wind!</p>

<p>How beautifully her hair grew! The brow was
queenly. How well it would look with an all-round
crown of diamonds surmounting it. Sir John would
probably give her something of the sort. These rich
parvenus&mdash;people with but a grandfather, perhaps&mdash;would
buy some flashy modern thing! That kind of
head would do justice to family jewels. He knew of
one particular crown which had belonged to a certain
Duchess of early regency days, which was reposing now
at Garrards, and which would be specially becoming.
Italy&mdash;she had spoken of Italy, she had never been
there; what a companion to take to Italy! She grasped
the spirit of countries. How she had understood
"Eothen!"</p>

<p>But the people were rising&mdash;the sermon was over.
Capital fellow, Woolman, his sermons were much
shorter, though, than they used to be. Would she walk
back across the park? Yes, of course, and he would
have to motor. What contemptible slaves civilisation
made of people!</p>

<p>As everyone was assembled in the hall on the way to
luncheon, the exasperated Duke came over to Katherine.</p>

<p>"Can I find shelter in the peaceful backwater again
this afternoon, Miss Bush? It is a vile day, you see,
and no tennis is possible."</p>

<p>"No, I am afraid not."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>"Does that mean no tennis or no backwater?"</p>

<p>"Both."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"The schoolroom is not intended for visitors, and
Sunday afternoon is the only time in which I can sit
in the armchair myself and read."</p>

<p>"I would not take more than the edge of the table, if
you would let me come," eagerly, "and we could talk
over what you are reading."</p>

<p>Katherine looked at him, and there was reproach in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Your Grace must know that it is altogether impossible
for you to come to the schoolroom; it could but
bring censure upon me&mdash;is it quite kind?"</p>

<p>He was contrite in a moment.</p>

<p>"Forgive me! I see my suggestion was not chivalrous&mdash;forgive
me a thousand times."</p>

<p>She moved on with the general company without answering
and it chanced at luncheon that the Duke could
see her face, and it looked to him rather sad. He felt
a number of things, and even though it rained he went
for a walk in the early afternoon alone.</p>

<p>There was obviously only one post which a woman
in her position in life could fill, in regard to a man in
his&mdash;&mdash;But every fine sentiment in him revolted at
the picture of it. That proud head could never bow
to the status of mistress. He must dismiss such vagrant
thoughts, he must dismiss all thoughts of her
except that she was a pleasant companion when chance
allowed him to be naturally in her society, for a minute
now and then.</p>

<p>There were so many other interests in his homecoming
which he must think of. His public duties,
which the tragic circumstances of his life had forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
him to waive for so long. There were politics, too.
The renovation of the London house&mdash;the plans for
the Season&mdash;the reopening of Valfreyne. By the way,
which rooms should he give to Seraphim and her secretary
for Whitsuntide? The Venetian suite on the
ground floor in the west wing. Seraphim should have
the bedroom and dressing-room and sitting-room, which
looked on to the park, and Miss Bush the smaller bedroom
hung with green damask adjoining&mdash;and how
would things be? She would be his guest then,
and should be treated with all honour. There
should be no more coming into the drawing-room after
dinner&mdash;and lunching if the numbers had to be made
up!</p>

<p>But to what end? This was ridiculous weakness,
this allowing his thoughts to dwell upon her so much.
He had better go back to the house and talk to one of
the newcomers&mdash;quite a nice woman, who was not intent
upon falling into his arms.</p>

<p>And Katherine sat in the schoolroom for a little, but
she did not read. She had seen the Duke from the
window for an instant passing the end of the rose
garden. The sight of him had made her sit down in
her armchair and begin to think.</p>

<p>Could the barrier of the enormous difference in their
positions ever be surmounted, after all? Dukes had
married even actresses in the past, but she would never
accept such a position as had been the lot of such
Duchesses. She must only wear the strawberry leaves
if they could be given her in all honour, and with the
sympathy and the approval of her own immediate
world. It almost looked as though her mistress's acquiescence
would be forthcoming. But there was yet
another side of the question; there was the recollection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
of the three days with Lord Algy. No faintest uneasiness
or regret about that episode had ever entered her
brain during all her friendship with Gerard except on
that one evening, after hearing of the misfortune of
Gladys and upon that one occasion when first she had
again seen the hotel in Paris. Now she was faced with
the thought what would the Duke say if he knew of this
circumstance in her life? With his lofty point of view,
his pride and his present great respect for her, the
knowledge would inevitably part them. And if he
should remain in ignorance and marry her, the secret
fear of his ever discovering the truth afterwards would
hang like Damocles' sword over her head. It would
insidiously and inevitably destroy the harmony and
perfect balance of her mind, necessary for her to carry
through the great task of playing successfully the part
of Duchess, and it would eventually spoil her whole
life.</p>

<p>She more than ever realised the certain reaction of
every single action committed, and of every thought
thought. Therefore the tremendous necessity of forethought.</p>

<p>Unless the mind is perfectly at peace with itself, she
knew it could never have magnetic force to propel its
desires, and must lose confidence and so fail to reach its
goal. This she realised fully. Her particular type and
logical brain, weighing all matters without sentiment,
totally uninfluenced by orthodox ideas as to morality if
such orthodox ideas did not seem to be supported by
common sense, caused her to feel no guilt, nor any so-called
conscience prickings on having taken Lord Algy
as a lover. They had both been free and were injuring
none. To her it appeared no sin, merely that such actions,
not being sanctioned by custom, would inevitably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
draw upon those who committed them the penalty attached
to breaking any laws, even should they be only
those of conventionality.</p>

<p>But beyond all this, there was another and quite
newly experienced emotion troubling her. It had arisen
sharply and suddenly in her breast, born of that
strange thrill she had felt when the Duke had kissed
her hand&mdash;&mdash;What if he&mdash;the man himself&mdash;should
grow to matter to her&mdash;matter as Algy had done, quite
apart from his Dukedom and his being the medium
through which she could gratify her ambitions?</p>

<p>What a unique, subtle, extraordinary emotion she
had experienced! She must keep her head; she must
not give way to such things. How hateful, how unbearable
it would be if one day she should see disgust
and contempt in those dark-blue eyes, instead of the
look of homage which had preceded the kiss!</p>

<p>Then she scolded herself. To fear was to draw inevitably
the thing feared. She must have no fears and
no regrets. She must pursue her plan with intelligence,
and if the feeling that she was using deception grew
to be insupportable, then she must have courage to
face the result of her own past action, and she must
admit herself beaten and retire from the game. She
went over the chances of discovery. Lord Algy would
never give her away; she had calculated upon that fact
when she had chosen an aristocrat for her partner in
initiation. There remained only the valet Hanson, who
had seen her often enough possibly to recognise her
again. But he did not know her real name, and had
shown no interest in her&mdash;too accustomed, probably, to
the changes in his master's fancies to remark upon individuals.
Also, she was so completely altered since
those days, no casual remembrance Hanson might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
kept of her would be likely to revive if he chanced to see
her now.</p>

<p>The odds were ten thousand to one that neither the
Duke nor anyone else would ever know of her adventure.
It thus resolved itself only into a question for her own
honest soul to decide.</p>

<p>The common sense way to look at everything was
that the time for these heart-searchings was not yet;
and that her energies must be concentrated upon continuing
to profit by the results of her first sensible
action in making the impression upon the Duke's imagination
unbiased by class prejudices.</p>

<p>So presently she grew quieter and at last fell asleep
over the wood fire, the volume of the "Letters of Abelard
and H&eacute;loise" still in her hand.</p>

<p>She was awakened after a while by the entrance of
Lady Garribardine, and quickly rose from her seat.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to disturb your well-earned Sunday
peace, Miss Bush, but some of the guests are growing
restive with the wet. Go and take charge of those in
the drawing-room and accompany their songs. I don't
think this party has been well chosen, the elements do
not assimilate."</p>

<p>Katherine was laboriously doing her duty when the
Duke came in. He did not attempt to come near her,
but stayed by the great centre fireplace talking to
one of the newcomers without his usual air of making
a virtue of necessity, which his attitude towards
the three charmers had hitherto suggested to Katherine.</p>

<p>She could get a good view of him from the piano, and
found her eye greatly pleased. He was certainly very
attractive. He had that same humorous and rather
cynical expression which so often distinguished her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
mistress. His figure was so perfect and his clothes,
with their air of a bygone day!</p>

<p>For a second, Katherine's hand seemed to tingle
again in the place which he had kissed, and she experienced
that nameless thrill which is half quiver and
half shock. She felt that she hated having to play
the accompaniments, and resented her position. It
gave her some relief to crash loud chords. None of
the younger men could approach the Duke in charm.
What was he talking to that woman about? Interesting
books? some of their mutual friends, perhaps?
She wished she could hear&mdash;but she could not. His
voice was lazy again; she caught its tones now and
then, but not the words, and the firelight made his emerald
ring sparkle. She wondered if there was some history
connected with it; it was so large and so unusual
a signet for a man to wear. How exquisite it would
have been to have been able to have let him come up
to the schoolroom, then she could have asked him about
it, perhaps. She sighed unconsciously, and presently
they all went in to tea.</p>

<p>There was some inscrutable expression in her eyes as
they met his in handing him his cup. They were a
little shadowed and sorrowful. They drew him like a
magnet, so that desire made him at last use sophistry
in his arguments with himself.</p>

<p>What harm could there be in a little casual conversation?
and he took a seat near.</p>

<p>"Had you profitable repose this afternoon in your
armchair, Miss Bush?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I hope so&mdash;I was sorting things and getting
them into their niches in my mind. I hope you had not
too wet a walk; I saw you from the window passing the
end of the rose garden."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish you had come out; the air was fresh and it
is rather nice to have the wet in one's face at times&mdash;&mdash;So
you put everything into niches in your mind? Was
it in chaos before, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, partly."</p>

<p>"What has caused this upset?"</p>

<p>"That&mdash;&mdash;" and there was a peculiar tone in her
voice&mdash;"I should much like to know&mdash;We seem to come
to new vistas in life, do we not&mdash;when everything must
be looked at in a fresh perspective?"</p>

<p>"That is very true&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And then we must call up all our sense of balance
to grasp the new outlines accurately, and not to be led
away into false conceptions through emotion."</p>

<p>The Duke was greatly interested. How exactly she
was describing his own state of mind&mdash;but what had
caused such thoughts to arise in hers?</p>

<p>"It is extremely difficult to see things as they are
when emotion enters into the question," he said, "and
how dull everything appears when it does not!"</p>

<p>She looked at him, and there were rebellion and suppressed
passion in her compelling eyes&mdash;and the Duke's
pulses suddenly began to bound; but this was the sole
exchange of sentences they were vouchsafed, for
Blanche Montague subsided into a sofa close to his side
and beamed at him with a whispered challenge. So
Katherine turned and devoted herself to some other
guests beyond.</p>

<p>She did not come into the drawing-room again that
night. She asked her mistress if she might be excused,
for if not really wanted, there were numbers of
letters to write. And Mordryn looked for her in vain,
and eventually man&oelig;uvred the conversation round to
the reason for her absence, when speaking to old Gwen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>doline
l'Estaire who, he had perceived, was devoted to
the girl.</p>

<p>"I think she must be tired to-night, having asked
Sarah to excuse her. I don't remember her ever to have
done such a thing before. She is such a dear child, I
don't know what Sarah would do without her&mdash;we are
all very fond of her. A perfect lady, wherever she
came from, but I really do not care from where."</p>

<p>"Of course not!" cordially responded the Duke. And
he wondered what had made her tired, and why her eyes
had been rebellious and sad. Was she wounded because
he had suggested coming to the schoolroom, with
the risk of drawing down censure upon her head? She
needed some explanation certainly from him, he felt,
upon this matter. It had been thoughtless on his part
and not really kind. He would not leave to-morrow,
after all. Why should not Gwendoline, who was stupid
and good-natured, be used to further his plans if the
chance to see Miss Bush looked too impossibly difficult
of attainment? But he went to bed with no sense of
happiness or satisfaction in his heart.</p>

<p>He liked rising early, and escaped to the rose garden
alone about nine o'clock on Easter Monday morning.
No windows but those of the smoking-room wing
and those of the picture gallery and the main hall
looked out upon this secluded spot. He had walked to
the end when he saw in the distance at a turn in the
shrubbery, the figure of Katherine disappearing towards
the park. This was luck, indeed! He hurried
after her, and overtook her as she opened the shrubbery
gate. She carried a basket of fresh eggs and a black
bottle.</p>

<p>"Whither away, Mistress?" he asked, as he raised
his cap and walked by her side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am going to take these to old Mrs. Peterson at
the far lodge; she has not been well these last days."</p>

<p>"Jacob's wife?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then may I come, too? I must have some exercise;
look upon it like that, since I strongly suspect if I
told you that it was simply for the pleasure of being
with you, you would send me back."</p>

<p>"I should not want to, but I suppose I should have
to say that."</p>

<p>She was looking very pretty in her rough homespun
suit and green felt hat. The wind had blown no
colour as yet into her cheeks, but had made her little
ears almost a scarlet pink. She seemed the embodiment
of sensuous youth and health and life. Her type was
so far from being ascetic. What ever the mental gifts
might be, Nature would have a strong say in everything
concerning her. The Duke admired her supple,
slender limbs, and he reflected, just as Gerard had
done long before, how very stately she would become
presently&mdash;if she married and had children&mdash;&mdash;Sir
John&mdash;but he banished Sir John!</p>

<p>"Shall we forget all those stupid conventions on this
wild March morning, and return to the stage in our
acquaintance at which we were when we said good-night
at Gerard Strobridge's?"</p>

<p>"That would be nice."</p>

<p>"Is it a bargain, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I am not to be 'Your Grace,' and you are not to
remind me every two minutes that you are Lady Garribardine's
secretary."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>"If you remember, the last words we had together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
then were finished by a question from you to me, as
to whether there was not something else in love beyond
that passionate side which you intimated that you
already knew."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember."</p>

<p>"I think there is a great deal more, but it would
not be complete alone. Love to be lasting must be a
mixture of both passion and idealism, but where can
one find such a combination in these days? The emotion
which most people call love is composed of self-interest,
and a little transitory exaltation of the senses.
But such old-fashioned and divine qualities as devotion
and tenderness and self-sacrifice are almost unknown."</p>

<p>Katherine did not speak; the "Letters of Abelard
and H&eacute;loise" were very fresh in her memory; one passage
in <i>H&eacute;loise's</i> first letter had struck her forcibly:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If there is anything that may properly be called happiness
here below, I am persuaded it is in the union of two
persons who love each other with perfect liberty, who are
united by a secret inclination and satisfied with each other's
merits. Their hearts are full of love and leave no vacancy
for any other passion; they enjoy perpetual tranquillity,
because they enjoy content.</p></blockquote>

<p>And now, with sudden illumination of the spirit, the
conviction came to her that this was the truth, and
that this man walking by her side talking in his exquisite
voice to her, looking at her with his deep blue
eyes, could inspire in her all the passion and all the devotion,
and all the tenderness which <i>H&eacute;loise</i> had felt
of old. And the magnitude of the discovery kept her
silent, with lowered lids.</p>

<p>He waited for her to speak, but when no words came,
he bent forward and looked into her face. The eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
which at last met his were troubled and sweet, and not
falcon-like in their proud serenity as usual.</p>

<p>"Do not let us talk about love," she said at last. "It
is a moving theme, and better left alone. Yesterday
I was reading the 'Letters of Abelard and H&eacute;loise,'
and it is wiser to remember the wisdom in this phrase
of <i>Abelard's</i> than to talk of love: 'What great advantages
would philosophy give us over other men, if by
studying it we could learn to govern our passions.'"</p>

<p>Mordryn smiled.</p>

<p>"Finish the quotation," he commanded, "or shall I?
'What efforts, what relapses, what agitations do we
undergo. And how long are we tossed in this confusion
unable to exert our reason to possess our souls, or to
rule our affections. What a troublesome employment
is love!' Philosophers remember <i>Abelard</i> as a great
scholar and ethical teacher, but he lives not by his
learning or his philosophy, but by the memory of his
profound and passionate love."</p>

<p>Katherine sighed.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is indeed divine, but please do not let
us talk of it; it makes everyday life grey and commonplace
by contrast."</p>

<p>The Duke was sufficiently master of himself to realise
that it was wiser to take her advice. To discuss
love on a March morning with this most attractive and
forbidden young woman was not wisdom, so he changed
the subject by expressing his contrition at having come
to the schoolroom. He hated to think that his chivalry
had been at fault.</p>

<p>Then they talked of many things, all in the abstract,
evolution and ethics and aspirations and
theories, and at last Katherine said:</p>

<p>"How glorious to be you! To have all that is noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
your own by right, and so to have leisure to let your
soul expand to the highest, without wasting it in the
struggle to emerge from clay."</p>

<p>Her deep voice had a passion in it, and her eyes
flashed. "You, and all aristocrats, should be grateful
to God."</p>

<p>Later in the day, Mordryn felt that it was fortunate
that at this particular moment they had reached the
gate of the far lodge, the opening of which broke the
spell, of what he might have answered he did not feel
altogether sure, so deeply had she affected him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peterson was a good deal better, it seemed, and
Katherine proposed to stay with her for half an hour&mdash;so
she came out of the door and asked the Duke not
to wait for her.</p>

<p>"Go back without me&mdash;I have been so happy&mdash;and
please&mdash;do not talk to me any more to-day&mdash;and, oh!
please, remember who you are and who I am, and leave
me alone."</p>

<p>And to his intense surprise and sudden unhinging,
her fearless glance was softened by a mist which might
have presaged tears.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>


<p>Mordryn spent a most unrestful day; he found
it very difficult to settle to anything. He felt
it wiser whenever his thoughts turned to Katherine
Bush, immediately to picture Bindon's Green and
the auctioneer father and butcher grandfather!&mdash;they
acted as a kind of antidote to the very powerful intoxicant
which was flooding his veins.</p>

<p>And Katherine sat typing mechanically her morning's
work, but some third sense beyond eye and hand
was busy with agitating thoughts. No, she could play
no further game with the Duke, fate had beaten her.
It would be no acting. She knew that she was just a
woman, after all, and he was a man, and the Dukedom
had gone into shadowland.</p>

<p>He possessed everything that Algy had lacked, there
would be no blank half-hours when passion was lulled,
with him. His perfectly cultivated intellect could enchant
her always. She adored his point of view, as
unconsciously arrogant as Lady Garribardine's, and
yet as free and expanded. How she could soar with
him to guide her! What happiness to take refuge from
everything in his arms.</p>

<p>He did not seem old to her; indeed, except for his
thick, iron-grey hair and the expression of having
greatly suffered, which now and then showed in his
proud eyes, there were no unlovely signs of age about
him. He could still call forth for many years the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
passionate love of women. And what was age? A ridiculous
phantasy&mdash;the soul was the thing.</p>

<p>Katherine was beginning to believe that she herself
had a soul, and that Otto Weininger was altogether
wrong about individuals, even if his deductions were
correct concerning the majority of women.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Several guardsmen from Windsor came over to
luncheon, which was so crowded that there was no necessity
for Katherine to go down, and tea came before
she again saw the Duke. He deliberately allowed himself
to be entrapped by one of the trio of Graces, and
did not come near her; and when Katherine got into
the drawing-room after dinner, he was nowhere in sight.
A Cabinet Minister, one of the few Her Ladyship considered
sufficiently worthy to be allowed to visit
Blissington, had arrived in the afternoon, and the Duke
and the hostess, and another man and woman, made
a group in the small, red drawing-room in earnest converse;
while most of the rest of the company danced
in the hall. And Katherine went among these, and
presently she slipped up to her old schoolroom.</p>

<p>His Grace was carrying out her request, it appeared,
but therein she found no joy.</p>

<p>And later, Mordryn drank his final hock and seltzer
in his old friend's boudoir, where they had a little talk
together alone.</p>

<p>"It has been dear of you to stay so long, Mordryn,"
she told him. "Especially as the diversions which I
hoped I had provided for you turned out of no more
use than a plague of gnats. I hope you have not been
too bored?"</p>

<p>"I am never bored with you, dear friend."</p>

<p>"No, I know that; but in a big party, I cannot give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
you as much time as I should like. You will come again
when we are quiet, though, just as you always used
to, and I will really find you a suitable bride."</p>

<p>The Duke was in a cynical mood, it seemed, for he
treated this proposal not at all in the light fashion he
had done at the beginning of the visit.</p>

<p>He replied gloomily that he had decided to select
something steady and plain, if he must marry&mdash;he
knew he could never care for a woman again, and a
healthy, quiet, well-bred creature with tact, who would
leave him alone, was all he asked. Life was a hideous
disappointment and very difficult to understand, and
to try to do one's duty to one's state, and get through
with it, was all that anyone could hope to accomplish.</p>

<p>But to this Her Ladyship said a vigorous, "Tut&mdash;tut!
You speak like a boy crossed in love, Mordryn!
If you were five-and-twenty, you could not have a
more delightful vista opening out in front of you, '<i>Si
jeunesse savait. Si vieillesse pouvait</i>'&mdash;that was cried
from a wise and envious heart! Well, you both <i>know</i>
and <i>can</i>, so what more could a man ask of fate! I
have no patience with you! I don't want you now only
to do your duty, to fulfil the obligations of your station.
You have always done so. Your life has been one
long carrying out of <i>noblesse oblige</i>. I want you to
kick over the traces and be happy, Mordryn! Ridiculously,
boyishly happy!&mdash;do you hear, conscientious
martyr!"</p>

<p>Mordryn heard, but his smile was still bitter, as he
answered:</p>

<p>"We are not so made, Seraphim, neither you nor I&mdash;we
could not do as you say, even when we were young,
and tradition and obligation to our order will still dominate
us to the end of time, dear friend."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he said good-night and good-bye&mdash;for he was
leaving at cock-crow for a place of his in the North.</p>

<p>When Lady Garribardine was alone, she did not look
at all disturbed at the passage of events, as she reviewed
her Easter party. She smiled happily, in fact,
and decided that she would take her secretary to Valfreyne
for Whitsuntide, after all!</p>

<p>Man "proposed," but, she reflected sagely, God often
"disposed" in favour of intelligent women!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the following week, the establishment from Blissington
moved up to Berkeley Square for the season,
and Katherine's duties became heavy again.</p>

<p>Her first meeting with Gerard Strobridge happened
quite soon; he came into the secretary's room from the
library after luncheon.</p>

<p>"Now tell me all about everything," he said. "I
have gathered from Gwendoline that you came down
every night and had your usual success at the Easter
party, and that Mordryn evidently liked you, for he
told Gwen that you were the most intelligent girl that
he had ever met."</p>

<p>Katherine half smiled, a little sadly.</p>

<p>"Yes, he may have thought so, but eventually the
secretary swallowed up the guest. I do not know if
he will ever speak to me again."</p>

<p>"He felt as badly as that, did he! Poor Mordryn!
No doubt you tormented him; but Mordryn is no weak
creature like me. If he feels very much about you, he
will either defy convention, or break away from all
temptation"&mdash;then his voice changed, and he asked
a little anxiously:</p>

<p>"Katherine, do you begin to care for him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"I do not know&mdash;I could care a great deal&mdash;he
pleases me in every way&mdash;I love his looks and his mind&mdash;and
he&mdash;he makes me feel something which I have
never felt before&mdash;is it the capability for devotion?&mdash;I
do not know."</p>

<p>For the first time in their acquaintance, Mr. Strobridge
saw her undecided, gentle, a little helpless even&mdash;it
touched him deeply. He loved her so very dearly.
He would rather see her happy if he could aid her to become
so. He came over to her and leaned upon the
table.</p>

<p>"Dearest girl&mdash;everything is a sickening jumble in
this world, it seems. I have a kind of premonition,
though, that you will emerge triumphant, however it
goes; but after to-day, Katherine, I shall not see you
until late in the autumn. I am going away&mdash;to Russia
this time&mdash;and I am going to try once more not to
care."</p>

<p>So even her one friend would be far from her. Well,
she must not lose her nerve. She gave him her blessing
for his journey, and they said good-bye. And the days
went on apace.</p>

<p>Matilda was engaged to be married to Charlie Prodgers,
and was full of importance and glee, and had
drifted further and further away from her sister ever
since the engagement was announced. Some instinctive
feminine jealousy made her feel that she would prefer
Katherine to be as far as possible from her fianc&eacute;.</p>

<p>"After all, Kitten," she said, when they met in the
park to discuss the news, "you aren't one of us and we
aren't one of you. I shall be moving up now into
Mabel's set, and there is no use in hiding it, Mabel don't
seem to dote on you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I feel that," agreed Katherine, meekly lowering
her eyes, so that her sister might not see their
twinkle. "I expect we shall not meet often in the future,
Tild."</p>

<p>"Well, of course, Kitten, I'd always be very pleased
to have tea with you up here now and then," and Matilda
gave an uncomfortable laugh; "but it is always
best to avoid awkwardness, isn't it, dearie, and you are
only a paid servant, aren't you&mdash;living in&mdash;not like
you were at Liv and Dev's, out on your own, and everyone
starts better in considering her husband's position,
don't they&mdash;and Charlie is manager in his department
now, and very particular as to who I know."</p>

<p>"You are perfectly right, Tild," Katherine's voice
was ominously soft, "and so is Charlie. You go ahead,
and very soon you will have got above Mabel, and, of
course, I would not be a drag on you for the world. I
think, after to-day, we will just write to one another
now and then, and you must not bother to come up to
see me. We do not think alike on any point&mdash;but I
shall always remember how good you were to me when I
was a tiresome little girl."</p>

<p>"Oh, Kitten!" and Matilda felt almost tearful; for
apart from her fear of reawakening her fianc&eacute;'s interest
in her sister, she still had a secret affection for her.</p>

<p>"Yes, you were very good to me, then, Tild, but now
we have come to a final parting of the ways, and we are
all satisfied&mdash;I shall fulfil my ideas, and you will fulfil
yours."</p>

<p>And afterwards, when she walked back to Berkeley
Square, she pondered deeply. There was no such thing
as family affection really in the abstract&mdash;it only held
when the individuals were in sympathy and had a community
of interests. They&mdash;her family&mdash;were as glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
at the thought that they had risen above her, and need
not communicate in the future, as she was that she
would not have to bring her mind down to their point
of view. Matilda was the last link&mdash;and Matilda had
shown that she desired also to break away. Katherine
felt that but for Lady Garribardine's real affection for
her, she was virtually alone in the world.</p>

<p>If only there were no backward thoughts in her mind,
she would have looked upon her fair future as a certainty;
sooner or later, with the visit to Valfreyne in
front of her, and the frequent occasions upon which she
must see the Duke at her mistress' house, she knew she
could continue to attract him if she so desired, and
make him love her with a great love. There was that
subtle, indescribable sympathy of ideas between them.
And as Algy had called forth physical passion, and
Gerard the awakening of the spirit, this man seemed to
arouse the essence of all three things, the body, the
spirit and the soul.</p>

<p>But there lay this ugly shadow between them, and
she began to realise the meaning of the old saw from
Horace, "Black care sits behind the horseman," and
she had not yet made up her mind to dislodge him and
defy fate.</p>

<p>The three days in Paris began to haunt her until she
severely took herself to task, and analysed everything.
She must not look back upon them in that fashion. She
must remember them gratefully, she told herself, since
they had opened her eyes for the first time in a way
that nothing else could have done, and she indeed felt
that it was very doubtful if she could ever have obtained
Lady Garribardine's situation, and so her education
from Gerard Strobridge, without the experience that
that episode in her life had given her to start upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<p>It was contrary to all her principles to allow any
past action to influence with its shadow present events.
She would banish the whole subject from her mind, and
leave the future in the hand of destiny&mdash;neither assisting
fate by personal initiative, nor resisting its march
by deliberate renunciation.</p>

<p>But she seemed very quiet, Her Ladyship thought,
and wondered to herself at the cause. The Duke was
in the North paying other visits for some weeks, and
when he did come to Berkeley Square in between times
he did not see Katherine.</p>

<p>So April passed and May came, and with it the prospect
of Whitsuntide, early that year. Whitsunday
fell upon the eleventh of May.</p>

<p>"You must have some decent clothes," Lady Garribardine
had said, a week or two beforehand, "another
evening dress and an afternoon frock. I think I should
like the first to be white and the other black, and in
your own excellent taste. You will dine down every
night as a guest, and we shall stay from Saturday until
Tuesday."</p>

<p>"It is extremely exciting for me," Katherine admitted.
"I wonder so much what the house will be
like."</p>

<p>"It is a huge Palladian Monument, very splendid and
ducal, everything is on an immense scale, and the Duke
keeps it up with great state. It is more like some royal
residence than a house, but there are some cosy rooms
to be found in odd corners. It will interest and educate
you, child. You had better read up all about it in one
of the old volumes of <i>Country Life</i>&mdash;some three years
ago, I think, it was described."</p>

<p>Katherine lost no time in doing this, and read of its
building in 1680, and of its wonderful gardens "in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
French style"&mdash;and of its superb collections of pictures
and art treasures, and of its avenues and lake and
waterways and fountains. Yes, it must be a very noble
place.</p>

<p>They were to arrive early in time for luncheon, since
Her Ladyship was to act hostess to the party who
would come in the afternoon. And when they approached
the gates, Katherine felt that one of the supreme
moments in her life had come.</p>

<p>The park was vast, larger even than Blissington, and
with more open spaces, and the house could be viewed
from a distance&mdash;a symmetrical, magnificent pile. And
it seemed that they walked through an endless succession
of halls and great salons, until they were ushered
into the Duke's presence in his own particular panelled
room.</p>

<p>It was very lofty and partly filled with bookcases
arranged in rather an unusual way, sunk into the wall
itself, with very beautiful decorations by Grinling Gibbons
surrounding them and also the intervening panels
wherein fine pictures hung. The curtains and chair
coverings were of the most superb old blue silk, faded
now to a wonderful greenish tone, and harmonizing
with the beautiful Savonnerie carpet with its soft tints
of citron and puce and green.</p>

<p>Katherine was frankly awed. Blissington was a very
fine gentleman's house&mdash;but this was a palace. And
suddenly, the Duke seemed a million miles away from
her, and she wondered how she had ever dared to be
familiar with him, and rebuke him for coming to her
schoolroom to talk!</p>

<p>She was meek as a mouse, and never opened her lips
after the first words of greeting.</p>

<p>The host had come forward with cordial gracious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>ness
and bidden them welcome, and he had looked a very
magnificent person somehow in his morning country
riding clothes. And all the glamour of high rank and
power and fastidiousness enhanced his natural charms,
so that Katherine felt a little cold and sick with the
emotion which she was experiencing. He was courtly
and aloof in his manner with all his kindness, and in a
moment or two he accompanied them along to the Venetian
suite himself.</p>

<p>"I must come, dear friend," he had said to Lady
Garribardine, "to be sure that you have everything
you can possibly want."</p>

<p>The Venetian suite was on a par in splendour with
the rest of the house. It was on the same floor as His
Grace's own sitting-room which they had left, and it
was reached by a passage place which led to the same
terrace, which the windows looked upon; this was
marble paved, with a splendid balustrade. The ante-chamber
had been arranged with a writing table near
the great window, and every convenience for Miss Bush
to do any writing her mistress might require. For the
rest, the Venetian suite was always reserved for the
most honoured guest. Here were a sitting-room, a
great bedroom and dressing-room for Her Ladyship&mdash;all
with the same lofty ceilings and fine windows as the
room they had left, and behind it came that charming
green damask-hung chamber designed for Miss
Bush.</p>

<p>"Here in this apartment you will find yourselves
completely quiet and shut off from the world," the Duke
said. "Once you have passed the great door, as you
know, Seraphim, your suite makes the end of this wing,
and only I can approach you from my sitting-room!"</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine, who knew every nook in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
house, smiled as she expressed herself as content, and
he left them alone.</p>

<p>Katherine examined her room; it would have struck
her as very large if it had been in any other house.
It looked on to an inner courtyard with a fountain
playing, and statuary and hundred-year-old lilac
bushes in huge tubs. The room was hung with pale
green silk, and had beautiful painted Italian, eighteenth
century furniture, and on the dressing-table were bowls
of lilies of the valley.</p>

<p>She thrilled a little; was this accidental or deliberate?</p>

<p>She was very well acquainted with the workings of
a great house, and the duties of the housekeeper and
groom of the chambers. She saw from a technical point
of view that these retainers of Valfreyne must be of a
very high order of merit because of the result of their
work; but even their intelligence could hardly have selected
the volumes of her favourite authors, which she
had discussed with the Duke, and which were placed in
bookstands, with the "Letters of Abelard and H&eacute;loise"
and a beautiful edition of "Eothen" out on the top!</p>

<p>These silent testimonies of someone's personal
thought gave her unbounded pleasure; they restored
her submerged self-confidence, and made her eyes
glow. It was divine to feel that he cared enough to
have troubled to do this. The subtle flattery was exquisite.</p>

<p>A burning wave of colour overspread Katherine's
face, and her nostrils quivered. If the Duke could
have seen her&mdash;he would have known that that quality
he appreciated&mdash;the quality of real, natural passion&mdash;was
abundantly present in her nature. Strong passion
controlled by an iron will&mdash;a mixture which he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
quite ideal in the woman whom a man would choose to
be the companion of his life.</p>

<p>It was this particular suggestion about Katherine
which had alike intoxicated the imaginations of these
three far different men, Lord Algy, Gerard Strobridge
and the Duke. The human, adorable warmth of emotion
of which her white, smooth-skinned face and red,
full mouth looked capable.</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine had told her secretary to take off
her hat, as she might be required to do a little work
after lunch.</p>

<p>"I shall settle with His Grace how I think the party
had better sit, and then you can type anything we
want."</p>

<p>So Katherine was particularly careful to arrange
her silvery hair becomingly, and looked the perfection
of refined neatness as she followed her mistress back
into the Duke's sitting-room, and then on in to luncheon
in a smaller dining-room in another wing.</p>

<p>They were only three at the meal, and the host
talked of politics, and the party who were coming, and
was gracious. He did not treat Katherine with the
slightest condescension, nor with any special solicitude.
If she had been an unknown niece of Lady Garribardine,
his manner would have been the same.</p>

<p>Katherine felt chilled again for the moment, and had
never appeared more subdued.</p>

<p>She slipped off back to her room when they went to
have coffee in a small drawing-room, known as "The
Gamester's Parlour," for in it was hung a world-known
picture of the famous thoroughbred of that name, the
riding of whom in a match against His Grace of Chandos'
colt, Starlight, had been the cause of the third
Duke's breaking his neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no immediate work to be done, so Katherine
stood and looked from the window of her green
chamber and took in the view. Surely, she thought, if
people even with the intelligence of Matilda could see
such men as the Duke and such splendid homes as this,
with every evidence in it of fine tastes and fine living and
fine achievement, stamped upon it by hundreds of years
of noble owners, they could not go on being so blind to
the force of heredity and environment as factors in
determining the actions of the human race.</p>

<p>She stood for a long time quite still, with trouble in
her heart, which every fresh realisation of the beauties
around her augmented.</p>

<p>No&mdash;the Duke could never overlook the three days
even if he could forget that she had come from Bindon's
Green&mdash;and she could not banish their memory
either, and so would never be able to rely upon her own
power to carry on the great undertaking untrammelled
by inward apprehension and self-contempt at the deception
of so great a man&mdash;her serenity would be gone
and with it her power.</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine opened the door presently, and
saw her still standing there.</p>

<p>"Run out for a little walk, child," she said, kindly.
"You can reach the terrace from the passage ante-chamber
which has been arranged for you to write in,
and there are steps at the side into the garden. I
shall not want you until just before tea. The Duke has
the menus and cards and door names printed by his own
private press. Then come back with your eyes bright,
and put on your new black frock."</p>

<p>Katherine thanked her; there never could be anyone
kinder or more thoughtful for others than was this arrogant
great lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl walked in the fresh May sunshine, but nothing
lifted the weight which had fallen upon her heart,
and her cheeks were paler than usual, and her air had
an added delicacy and refinement when she followed
her mistress into the great tapestry salon, wherein tea
was laid, and which was adjacent to the hall where
guests were already beginning to arrive.</p>

<p>She was not introduced to anyone else, but several
she already knew; they were selected from the <i>cr&ecirc;me de
la cr&ecirc;me</i> of Her Ladyship's set of the rather less modern
sort.</p>

<p>Mordryn looked at her constantly unobserved.
What was the meaning of this new expression in her
face? Why would she never meet his eyes? And hers,
when he did see them, turned upon ordinary things,
had a haunting melancholy in them very different from
the sphinxlike smile of old.</p>

<p>He found himself more disturbed than he cared to
own. He wished Seraphim had not brought her, after
all&mdash;He wished&mdash;but he did not even in his thoughts
form words. Had her changed air anything to do with
that last abrupt request on the March morning's walk,
that he should remember who she was and who he was,
and leave her alone? Was it possible that she felt
something for him? How wrong he had been in that
case to put the "Eothen" and the "Abelard and H&eacute;loise"
and the lilies of the valley in her room&mdash;cruel and
wrong. He knew now that he saw her again that he had
thought of her very constantly ever since Easter time,
and had chafed at getting no sight of her when he had
twice been in London and had gone to Berkeley Square,
though his determination had held at that time,
and he had made no attempt to see her, or even
to mention her name. But he knew that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
looked forward more eagerly each day to Whitsuntide,
and that he had taken peculiar delight in the surreptitious
supervision of the details of her lodgment,
and the choice of volumes wherewith to refresh her
mind.</p>

<p>But was this chivalrous on his part? Was he not
playing upon the feelings of one defenceless and in a
dependent position&mdash;one who could not even flee?</p>

<p>He grew uncomfortable. He was painfully conscious
of her presence, and a sudden mad longing came to him
to take her in his arms, and kiss away the trouble from
her eyes! And then the cynical and humorous side of
his character made him smile at the idea of such feelings
in a room full of guests! Guests of his own world,
and for the humble secretary of his old love! He
fretted under the restraint of his unease. And she was
here in his house and he must suffer the temptation of
her presence for three more days. He must not look
at her&mdash;must not talk to her! He must not have any
subtle understanding with her about the books&mdash;must
not, in short, do anything he desired.</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine watched the passage of events
with an understanding eye. Something further must be
done, she felt.</p>

<p>So just before dressing time, when the company had
dispersed, she went with her host into his own sitting-room.
The evening post had come in.</p>

<p>"Mordryn, I wanted to ask you, can I send a wire
over to Hornwell. I have just heard Sir John Townly
is staying there, and I want to suggest that he motor
over to-morrow to tea. It will be a splendid chance for
him to have a quiet hour with my Katherine Bush. I
would like him to see her here as a guest; he is very
much in love with her in his heavy way, and I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
I could get the matter settled all right if you would only
help me, like a dear."</p>

<p>The Duke experienced a most unpleasant twinge.
This was rather more than he had bargained for! Why
should Sir John Townly be given this opportunity in his
house!</p>

<p>"The match is quite unsuitable, Seraphim. I can't
think how you can countenance it."</p>

<p>Her Ladyship appeared deliberately to misunderstand
him.</p>

<p>"But I assure you, Mordryn, Sir John is not in the
least upset by her origin or her suburban relations; he
realises the magnificent qualities of the creature herself,
and he knows very well that she will make the finest
hostess, and the most dignified figurehead for Dullinglea
that he could find; besides, with her health and
youth, he can look forward to a strong little son by
this time next year."</p>

<p>Mordryn found himself absolutely revolted&mdash;Katherine&mdash;(so
her name was Katherine?) Katherine&mdash;this
delicious creature to be the mother of that shocking
bore John Townly's son!</p>

<p>The red flush mounted to his broad forehead.</p>

<p>"It is not their relative worldly positions I alluded
to, Seraphim&mdash;but their ages and appearances&mdash;and,
oh! tastes! I think it is perfectly inhuman of you,
and I cannot countenance such a thing."</p>

<p>"Mordryn! I am really surprised!&mdash;how can it possibly
matter to you? You must have seen for yourself
that night at Gerard's what a charming companion
she can make, and how utterly she is wasted in the position
of secretary&mdash;and yet you won't help me to do
the poor child this good turn!"</p>

<p>"If you put it in that way&mdash;ask whom you like, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
I cannot think how any woman, to escape any position,
could sell herself to such a man as John Townly!"</p>

<p>His tone was heated and his blue eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"That is just the tiresome part of it," and Her
Ladyship looked concerned. "I believe she has your
same foolish and romantic ideas, and so I thought if
she could see him here among this fine company, perhaps
the desire to remain in it, and the glamour of the
thing might bring her up to the scratch. Mordryn,
do help me like a kind friend. Just think, if she were
to leave me, whom else would she ever see? She has
quite separated from her own family; she has nothing
but a life of drudgery in front of her, and she is fitted
in every way to be a queen. She is so extremely self-controlled,
she would never make any slips afterwards,
and her ambitions could be gratified and make up for
lack of love."</p>

<p>"I think the idea is disgusting," His Grace snapped
impatiently; "but send your wire, by all means."</p>

<p>Then he abruptly turned the conversation, and presently
Her Ladyship left him alone, very well pleased
with her work! And the groom of the chambers was
handed a warmly worded invitation to telegraph to
Hornwell, as she passed to her room.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h2>


<p>When he was left alone the Duke swore
sharply to himself. He was not a man accustomed
to the use of strong language&mdash;but
occasions arose in life sometimes when a good sound
oath seemed to relieve tension!</p>

<p>Then he paced up and down his long room. His
imagination was on fire. He could see Katherine&mdash;he
dwelt on the name "Katherine"&mdash;in the baboon embrace
of old John Townly&mdash;loathsome picture!</p>

<p>Yes, of course, she would adorn any position, and
Dullinglea was only a very moderate house. He could
see her tall, slender, graceful figure sweeping in rich
velvets through much larger rooms than it contained.
Such rooms, for example, as these, his own at Valfreyne!</p>

<p>She would sit to-night between young Westonborough
and old Barchester, but in a place where a gap in the
flowers would give him, the host, a continuous view of
her.</p>

<p>Then he went off to dress, in a fiery mood!</p>

<p>Katherine, meanwhile, had been looking over
"Eothen," and noting the marked passages, which she
found to be the same mutual favourites they had discovered
that night at Gerard's.</p>

<p>Had her host underlined them since then, or were
they marked before? Then she peeped at "Abelard
and H&eacute;loise" and turned over all the leaves. None of
them had any pencillings, but her eye caught this sen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>sible
paragraph, and it stiffened her jaded spirit, and
made her feel more calm:</p>

<p>"'How void of reason are men,' said Seneca, 'to
make distant evils present by reflection, and to take
pains before death to lose all the comfort of life.'"</p>

<p>She was here at a splendid party as a guest like
everyone else, and she must enjoy it and forget anything
but the pleasure of the moment. But oh! if the Duke
would only talk to her!</p>

<p>She wore the new white frock and looked quite beautiful,
and some of the lilies of the valley shone in her
belt.</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine was extremely pleased with her
appearance and patted her arm.</p>

<p>"To-morrow Sir John Townly is coming over from
Hornwell, child, and I want you to be agreeable to
him for me, as I shall be very busy. You must take
him for a little walk."</p>

<p>Her Ladyship knew that however irksome it would
appear to Katherine, her command would be obeyed!</p>

<p>The Duke's eyes were full of suppressed passion at
dinner, and his wit was caustic. Katherine could not
hear it, but could see his face, and the puzzled expression
which now and then came over the two ladies on
either side of him; and once she met his gaze, and there
was pain and a challenge in it. Excitement rose in her
before dessert came. She knew&mdash;she felt&mdash;he was conscious
of her presence&mdash;and that it was not indifference
which kept him from her side. What was it all leading
to? It was very evident that he was determined not
to succumb to whatever it might be. It was also evident
that he certainly did experience emotion.</p>

<p>Katherine felt unhappy, but this must not prevent
her from talking politely and sympathetically to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
ladies she happened to be sitting next to in the great
drawing-room, until the men came in. She remarked
how protective and gracious her own dear Ladyship
was being to her, saying a word in passing and making
her feel at home and an equal and a guest. She must be
very grateful for these things and not look ahead.</p>

<p>Why had this new and sudden sense of values come
over her? This realisation of the frightful obstacle created
by the blemish of the three days? At the dinner
at Gerard's she had not so much as remembered them,
their meaning had come in a flash with the thrill of
the Duke's kiss of homage upon her hand. Had she
been contemplating union with Sir John, she would have
looked upon them as a fortunate experience to guide her
in her knowledge of men. So this was some psychological
witness to the demands of the spirit of&mdash;love! Of
love that desires to give only the pure gold untarnished
to the lover.</p>

<p>She felt like a caged bird, and her triumphant evening
of pleasing women, and earning the admiration of
all who spoke to her, tasted only as Dead Sea fruit.</p>

<p>Now the Duke, when the men left the dining-room,
walked straight to his own sitting-room. He was a man
of rapid action and supreme self-confidence. He opened
the inner door softly and listened&mdash;there was no sound,
he could move with impunity. There was no one in
the passage room, but there was not a moment to be
lost; the housemaids, he knew, would be coming round
almost immediately with the cans of hot water for the
night. He crossed the space and deliberately entered
the green room, turning on the light as he did so.</p>

<p>He hastily looked about at the books&mdash;Yes, she had
put the two special ones by her bed. And "Abelard and
H&eacute;loise" was underneath; he pulled it out and quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
found a passage he wanted and with his gold pencil
he scored it deeply underneath, and putting the
volume on the top he swiftly left the room and was
again in his own, and on his way to the white drawing-room.
The whole affair had not taken two minutes.
And with the knowledge of this fact accomplished,
he looked almost serene as he sat down by a
great lady's side and determinedly avoided looking at
Katherine.</p>

<p>So the evening passed without speech between them
beyond good-night, and Miss Bush retired sorrowfully
to bed.</p>

<p>But she could not sleep, and kept on the light to read.
There were "Eothen" and "Abelard and H&eacute;loise" close
to her side, their order of placing reversed, since she
had left them, this change effected by the housemaids,
no doubt. And the love letters being on the top, she
opened them first. She read many exquisite thoughts,
and was just thinking of sleep when she turned a page
and suddenly sat bolt upright in bed, for this is what
she read:</p>

<p>"I wish to heaven you had not such a power over
me." And the passage was deeply underlined.</p>

<p>Her heart beat to suffocation. There had been no
such mark in this place when she had read this very
page before dinner. How had it come there?&mdash;Who&mdash;Who?&mdash;But
there was only one person who could have
done such a thing&mdash;the Duke!</p>

<p>She bent nearer the lamp and devoured the lines
again, and then she passionately kissed the words and
turned out the light.</p>

<p>Next day, Sunday, a number of the party went to
church, their host among them&mdash;but Katherine and
Lady Garribardine did not accompany them. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
were seated on the tennis lawn watching a game when
the church-goers joined the group.</p>

<p>Three magnificent cedars of Lebanon made a great
patch of shade, and here the chairs were placed. The
Duke took one and stretched himself on it as though
fatigued. His grey felt hat was tilted over his eyes.
He made a pleasing picture of length of limb and
grace and distinction&mdash;the same curious emotion crept
over Katherine again as she had already experienced&mdash;half
quiver, half shock&mdash;a strong desire to be very close
to him, to touch him, to feel herself caressing and caressed.
His hands were clasped idly upon his knee,
and his voice as he spoke softly to a lady was lazy and
complacent. Oh! how extremely bitter the whole situation
was proving to be!</p>

<p>The emerald ring seemed to flash green fire as a tiny
glint of sunlight struck it; it caught the attention
of the sprightly dame to whom His Grace was
talking.</p>

<p>"What a very wonderful ring that is you wear,
Duke. Has it a history?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a very remarkable one."</p>

<p>Katherine listened, deeply interested, she had so often
wondered about this ring, too.</p>

<p>"It has been in the family since the last Crusade. It
came back with the tradition attached that it was the
famous graven emerald seal which Theodoras made
for Polycrates, tyrant of Samos, about 590 B. C., and
which was in vain thrown into the sea to be lost! It
was brought back to Polycrates in the body of a fish
next day. Such exampled luck was considered to be
ominous by his ally, Amasis, who broke off all alliance
with him in consequence. And truly enough, he was
not long after murdered from jealousy of his good for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>tune!
The ring then disappeared and was supposed
later to have been found by a Roman who handed it
down for generations until it somehow got back into
Greece, and when wrecked there on his way home from
Palestine, the Rievaulx of the day obtained it from
its owner, how, history does not say, and it has always
been with us ever since&mdash;a strange belief attaching to
it&mdash;that if life is happy it must not be worn, but that
if things have gone ill then it is safe to wear it for the
rest of time."</p>

<p>He put out his hand for the lady to look at the stone
and a knot of interested people drew near.</p>

<p>"You see," His Grace continued, "it is deeply graven
with a lyre&mdash;and sometimes it seems to be dull and
sometimes it flashes angrily."</p>

<p>"Are you not afraid to wear it?" some tactless person
said.</p>

<p>The Duke replied gravely&mdash;"Why should I be? I
have amply fulfilled all the conditions attached," and
then the company, remembering the dark and ugly
shadow of the mad Duchess, which had hung over his
life for so many years, all seemed to talk at once and
so the slightly awkward moment passed.</p>

<p>But Katherine thought deeply upon the subject as
she sat in a wicker chair.</p>

<p>Yes, how ill his life had gone, and he was now fifty-three
years old, and if it were true that he felt enough
to have taken the trouble to score that sentence in her
book, his present frame of mind could not be altogether
happy either, and she sighed&mdash;why was happiness so
often a forbidden fruit?</p>

<p>For a second before lunch she happened to be standing
near him, and so some kind of words were necessary
for politeness' sake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope you find your room comfortable, Miss Bush,
and that you have all that you want."</p>

<p>She looked straight into his eyes, and there was a
world of meaning in hers as she answered.</p>

<p>"Everything, thank you&mdash;and I am especially interested
in the books. The last guest who slept there must
have taken liberties with your volumes and put strange
pencillings under some of the paragraphs, which I only
discovered last night."</p>

<p>"It was a man who occupied the room lately. What
presumption he showed!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I wondered if you knew about it, the most
significant marking is in the letters of 'Abelard and
H&eacute;loise.' The scribbler had a turn for sentiment, it
would seem, and probably was suffering from hallucinations
as to his own state, which he imagined to be one
of subjection."</p>

<p>"No, he was a level-headed fellow, who was not particularly
happy, though. I remember, and no doubt he
found solace in reading about the despairing passion of
those two, and in underlining that passage which records
<i>Abelard's</i> rebellion against pain so like his own."</p>

<p>Katherine sighed. "Happiness, alas! lies in the hand
only of the very strong," and she passed on to another
group.</p>

<p>And the Duke frowned a little as they went in to
lunch.</p>

<p>Sir John Townly came over in the afternoon, as he
had been invited to do, and Lady Garribardine intimated
to her secretary that now she must take this incubus
off her hands; so Katherine obediently proposed
a stroll round the wonderful tulip beds, which were in
full bloom. And Mordryn saw them go off together
from the window where he stood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p>"I really do not think it looks so ridiculous after all,"
Lady Garribardine remarked to him reflectively, complacence
in her tone. "He is quite a fine figure of a
man except for his perfectly bald head, and that does
not show now in his hat."</p>

<p>The Duke made an exclamation of disgust.</p>

<p>"Poor Miss Bush!"</p>

<p>"I do hope she won't be foolish, but she has been so
odd lately; I cannot understand these girls."</p>

<p>"Odd?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;sad-looking and quiet&mdash;Of course I would not
force her into anything she did not like, but still, Sir
John would be better than some attractive and penniless
young guardsman with nothing to offer but love's
young dream.&mdash;There are one or two who come over
from Windsor who rather hang about."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, certainly," emphatically agreed the Duke,
and then he thought of another sentence in that book
which seemed such a bond between them, one where
<i>Abelard</i> wrote, "What a comfort I felt in seeing you
shut up!" Yes, to marry old Sir John would almost
be the equivalent of a convent. But not quite! There
was always the thought that, however old, he would still
be the undisputed possessor of this most desirable piece
of womanhood! His would be the right to clothe and
feed her, and give her jewels. His to hold her in his
arms. The realisation of all this was maddening to
Mordryn, for he no longer disguised from himself that
he profoundly desired to exercise these rights himself.
And she had said that happiness only lay in the hands
of the very strong.&mdash;Yes, but how could one define
strong? Strong in fidelity to tradition and family and
race and class? Or strong to break all barriers and
seize that thing a man's heart cries out for passion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>ately,
his mate, his soul's and his body's mate? These
were problems which were distressingly agitating to
think over, and distracted his mind from the duties
towards guests.</p>

<p>What a time she spent in pointing out those tulips
to that old fool! What pompous gallantry his attitude
expressed! Of course the girl must be bored to death.
Why had she been "odd" lately, "quiet and sad"?
Oh, how divine it would be to go off to the Belvedere
presently and see the sunset from over there by the
lake, and ask her many things, and then as they looked
on the water from the marble terrace, if the falcon's
eye grew sweet again and soft, to read dear messages
there, and fold her to his heart!</p>

<p>She was so subtle, she understood every shade in
anything he said, they had the same tastes and the same
likings in books and art. She did not know Italy and
France; what supreme pleasure to wander there, and
discover their manifold beauties to her! And above
all, she was young and fresh and passionate&mdash;who could
doubt it who looked into her fair face, or knew anything
about type? If she loved him she would never be
cold, but would amply repay him for his long starvation
and abstinence from joy. The lonely splendour
of Valfreyne would then become a happy home filled
with interest and affection. How was he going to get
through another twenty years of dull duty after his
twenty-five of anguish and grief? He supposed he
might live to be eighty, even, the Monluces were a tenacious
race!</p>

<p>Here Lady Garribardine deemed it prudent to divert
his thoughts; she realised that the moment for the final
good which would draw him over the brink into happiness
had not yet come, so she spoke of soothing things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
and then amused him and coaxed him into a more peaceful
state; only again to see him restive when the pair
eventually came in from the tulip beds.</p>

<p>Katherine looked tired and depressed, but Sir John
had an air of gratification about him which made
Mordryn feel that he could willingly have punched his
head!</p>

<p>His good manners alone enabled him to bid a cordial
farewell to the poor man when presently he left.</p>

<p>The sun was declining and the colours were opal over
the lake. The duties of host to so many charming
ladies restrained the Duke and he had the mortification
of seeing Katherine and another girl go off with two
of the young men in two canoes on the topaz waters,
and by the time he went to dress he was almost desperate.</p>

<p>Katherine was in black to-night, and a red rose was
in her belt. Where had she got it from? Had that
insupportable young Westonborough, whom she had
been in the canoe with, given it to her? Surely Bilton
had not been so remiss as not to have seen that fresh
lilies were put in the green room!&mdash;But perhaps she
preferred the red rose; women were incredibly fickle
and capricious!</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine perceived the expression of fierceness
in his eyes, and so contrived that even a single
sentence with Katherine was impossible. And thus the
evening passed and good-nights were said, and there
remained only the one more day!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a></h2>


<p>Katherine read "Abelard and H&eacute;loise" far
into the night. Her emotions were complex.
She knew now that she was very unhappy and
in a corner, and that she could not see clearly any way
of escape. If she attracted the Duke further it would
only increase the complications.</p>

<p>There was something in her nature which she feared
was not strong enough to carry through deceit. Her
great power had always lain in her absolute honesty,
which gave her that inward serenity which engenders
the most supreme self-confidence, and so inevitably
draws the thing desired. Her mind was too balanced,
and too analytical to give way to impulse regardless
of cost, which in such a situation would have made nine
hundred and ninety-nine women out of a thousand grab
at the chance of securing Mordryn upon any terms.
Of what good to obtain the position of Duchess if it
only brought a haunting unease? Of what good to obtain
the love of this true and splendid gentleman upon
false pretences? She could then enjoy nothing of the
results. For above all worldly gains she was well aware
that to keep her own rigid self-respect mattered to her
most. If his character had been less worthy of reverence&mdash;if
she had not grown so near to passionately
loving him&mdash;if she had not become aware of the importance
in the eyes of the world of the barrier between
them, and so of the magnitude of the offence involved in
the deceit, she would have played her game to a finish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
without a backward thought; but as it was it were better
frankly to give it up and perhaps marry&mdash;Sir John!
For none of these considerations, she felt, came into
the question of marrying Sir John. He was old and
pompous and of no great family. She would be giving
more than she received in bestowing her youth and her
talents and her company upon him. She did not love
him, therefore whether he should ever look upon her
with scorn or no was a matter of indifference to her&mdash;and
she would not for a moment have dreamed of any
obligation to reveal that episode in her past to him,
since the probabilities were so very remote that discovery
could ever happen and therefore her silence
would in no way injure him. It would be merely a bargain
in which an old man bought a young woman
"as she stood," so to speak, for the pleasure of his
eye.</p>

<p>But the Duke of Mordryn was different&mdash;between
them there could be no deceptions, no secrets, there
must be none but the highest things, since marriage
with him would mean the union of their souls. Katherine
was far from being altruistic or sentimental, it
was only the strictly common sense and baldly honest
aspect of any case that ever influenced her.</p>

<p>The temptation was overpowering, of course, to
brush aside moral qualms.&mdash;To think of reigning in this
splendid place!&mdash;and she let her imagination run on&mdash;To
think of being with the Duke always&mdash;his loved
companion. The joy to make him very happy, and do
everything he wished. What pains she would take to
fulfil his highest ideal of her&mdash;to show to his world that
whatever she had sprung from, at least she carried off
the situation of Duchess in a manner in which they
could find no flaw. She would be gracious and sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
and dignified and capable. She would bring all her
reasoning to bear upon all problems. She would let
him guide and direct her, and she would carry out his
least behest.</p>

<p><i>But it could not be.</i> She had made an initial mistake
and miscalculation in her career through ignorance
of possible results, and she could never shuffle
out of it. Self-deception was of all mental attitudes
the one she despised the most. She must face the consequence
of her mistake now with courage, and take the
second best.</p>

<p>Having once made up her mind in the early dawn,
it was not in her nature to indulge in further repining.
She as resolutely shut out the image of the Duke and
the picture of happiness with him, as she had shut out
Lord Algy. Only this time the pain was infinitely more
bitter, because she knew that she was obliged to refrain
from sipping this glorious cup <i>because of her own miscalculation</i>.
Whereas when she parted from Lord Algy
she had had the moral elation of knowing that she was
doing rather a fine thing.</p>

<p>Extreme pallor showed in her face in the morning,
and her great eyes were shadowed and sad. She remained
in the ante-chamber at the writing-table which
had been prepared for her, after she had breakfasted
with Lady Garribardine in her sitting-room. Numbers
of letters had come by the Sunday's post, and she made
it seem necessary to answer them at once.</p>

<p>Her mistress allowed her to have her way. She felt
some strong underneath currents were affecting the girl,
and further tantalization would not be bad for the
Duke. So she left her at the writing-table and joined
the rest of the party under the cedar trees on the tennis
lawn, and did not mention Katherine or her where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>abouts.
If Mordryn wanted to know why she had not
come out, or where she was, he must pluck up courage
to ask himself.</p>

<p>The Duke glanced at her enquiringly, but he said
nothing&mdash;perhaps Katherine would follow presently&mdash;but
could she have gone again on the lake with Lady
Alethea and those empty-headed young men? He would
not ask, he would go himself and see.</p>

<p>So when he had disposed of his important guests,
he went to his own sitting-room from which there was
a complete view of the waterways, and then he took
the trouble to get out his glasses and scan the occupants
of the boats.</p>

<p>No, she was not among them.</p>

<p>She must then either be still in her bedroom&mdash;or writing
perhaps in front of the window of the passage place
which was next this very room!</p>

<p>He would go out on the terrace from one of the windows
and look in.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;she was there seated at the table very busy, it
appeared.</p>

<p>He came forward and stepping across the threshold,
he stood beside her.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Miss Bush&mdash;it is quite wrong for
you to be working on this glorious day. You must
come out into the sunshine with the rest of us."</p>

<p>Katherine did not rise or appear to be going to follow
his suggestion, so he added authoritatively:</p>

<p>"Now be a good girl and go and get your hat."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry I cannot before lunch; I have much
work to do, and it becomes disorganised if I leave it
unfinished."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You did not come to Valfreyne to work.
There are such a number of things I want to show you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
Everyone is out in the garden, won't you at least come
round the state rooms with me?"</p>

<p>How could she refuse him? He was her host and the
pleasure would be so intense. She rose, but without
alacrity and answered a little stiffly:</p>

<p>"I should much like to see them&mdash;if it will not take
very long."</p>

<p>Her manner was distinctly different, he noticed it
at once&mdash;a curtain seemed to have fallen between them
ever since the conversation about the pencillings in the
book. It chilled him and made him determined to remove
it.</p>

<p>He held the door into his sitting-room open for her,
and took pains to keep the conversation upon the
ostensible reason for their voyage of inspection. He
spoke of carving and dates, and told her anecdotes of
the building of Valfreyne. And so they passed on
through all the splendid rooms, "The King's Chamber,"
and "The Queen's Closet,"&mdash;and the salons and
so to the great state suite of her who should be reigning
Duchess.</p>

<p>And Katherine saw priceless gems of art and splendour
of gilding and tapestry, and hangings, and great
ghostly beds surmounted with nodding ostrich plumes.
And stuffs from Venice and Lyons&mdash;and even Spitalfields.</p>

<p>"How wonderful!" she said at last&mdash;"And there are
many other places such as this in England! How
great and rich a country it is. We&mdash;the middle class
population&mdash;shut in with our narrow parochial views&mdash;do
not realise it at all, or we would be very proud
of our race owning such glorious things, and would not
want to encourage stupid paltry politicians to destroy
and dissipate them all, and scatter them to the winds."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>

<p>"It may seem hard in their view that one man should
possess, we will say, Valfreyne."</p>

<p>"But how stupid! How could it all have been accumulated,
but for individual wealth and taste and tradition?
Who really cares for museums except to study
examples in? Do you know, for instance, such people
as my sisters would a thousand times rather walk
through these rooms on a day when the public is let
in, feeling it was a house owned by people who really
lived there, than go to any place given to the nation,
like Hampton Court or the Wallace Collection."</p>

<p>"That is the human interest in the thing."</p>

<p>"Yes, but the human and the personal are the strongest
and most binding of all interests."</p>

<p>Mordryn looked at her appreciatively&mdash;he delighted
in hearing her views.</p>

<p>"Then you have no feeling that you wish all this to
be divided up among the people of Lulworth, say&mdash;the
large town near?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no, no! So strongly do I feel for the law by
which all goes to the eldest son, that were I a younger
one, I would willingly give up my share to ensure the
family continuing great. Who that can see clearly
would not rather be a younger son of a splendid house,
than a little, ridiculous nobody on his own account,&mdash;if
everything were to be divided up."</p>

<p>"It is so very strange that you should have this
spirit, Miss Bush. If you had not told me of your
parentage I should have said you were of the same root
and branch as Lady Garribardine. Are you sure you
are not a changeling?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure. How proud it must make you feel
to own Valfreyne, and what obligations it must entail!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," and he sighed.</p>

<p>"It must make you weigh every action to see if it is
worthy of one who must be an example for so many
people."</p>

<p>"That is how you look upon great position&mdash;it is a
noble way."</p>

<p>"Why, of course&mdash;it could not be right to hold all
this in trust for your descendants, and for the glory of
England, and then to think yourself free to squander
it, and degrade the standard. All feeling would have
to give way to worthily fulfilling your trust."</p>

<p>The Duke felt his heart sink&mdash;a strange feeling of
depression came over him.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right," and he sighed again.</p>

<p>"I was so much interested in the story of your ring,"
she said presently, to lift the silence which had fallen
upon them both. "It is such a strange idea that great
good fortune is unlucky&mdash;since we always draw what
we deserve. If we are foolish and draw misfortune at
the beginning of our lives, we must of course pay the
price, but if people's brains are properly balanced they
should not fear good fortune in itself."</p>

<p>"You think then that a whole life need not be
shadowed with misery, but that if the price of folly is
paid in youth, there may still be a chance of a happy
old age?"</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;One must be quite true, that is all, and
never deceive anyone who trusts one."</p>

<p>"That would mean living in a palace of truth and
would be impracticable."</p>

<p>"Not at all. There are some things people have no
right to ask or to be told&mdash;some things one must keep
to oneself for the carrying on of life&mdash;but if a person
has a right to know, and trusts you and you deceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
him, then you must take the consequences of unhappiness
which is the reflex action of untruth."</p>

<p>"How wise you are, child&mdash;that is the whole meaning
of honour, 'To thine own self be true and it must
follow as the night the day, Thou canst not then be
false to any man.'"</p>

<p>She looked straight up into his eyes, hers were pure
and deep and sorrowful.</p>

<p>"Now I have seen your beautiful home I must go
back to my work&mdash;I shall always remember this visit,
and this happy morning&mdash;all my life."</p>

<p>Mordryn was deeply moved, passionate emotion was
coursing through him&mdash;with great difficulty he restrained
the words which rose to his lips. He did not
seek to detain her, and they retraced their steps, speaking
little by the way, until they came to his sitting-room.</p>

<p>"When you go to-morrow, will you take with you
the 'Eothen' and the 'Abelard and H&eacute;loise?' I would
like to know that you read them sometimes and there
is one passage in <i>Abelard's</i> first letter which I know
I shall have to quote to myself&mdash;It is on the fifty-fourth
page, the bottom paragraph&mdash;you must look at
it some time&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then his voice broke a little&mdash;"And now let us say
good-bye&mdash;here in my room."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," said Katherine and held out her hand.</p>

<p>The Duke took it and with it drew her near to him.</p>

<p>"Good-bye&mdash;Beloved," he whispered, and his tones
were hoarse, and then he dropped her hand; and Katherine
gave a little sob, and turning, ran from the room,
leaving him with his proud head bent, and tears in his
dark blue eyes.</p>

<p>And she made herself return to her work&mdash;nor would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
she permit her thoughts to dwell for an instant upon
the events of the morning, or the words of the Duke&mdash;for
she knew that if she did so she would lose control
of herself and foolishly burst into tears. And there
was lunch to be endured, and the afternoon and
evening.</p>

<p>So this was the end&mdash;he loved her, but his ideas of
principle held.&mdash;And if she was only a common girl
and so debarred from being a Duchess&mdash;the Duke
should see that no aristocrat of his own class could be
more game.</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine found her still writing diligently
when she came in just before luncheon would be announced,
and she wondered what made the girl look
so pale.</p>

<p>"It is quite too bad that you have sat here all this
time," she exclaimed. "I won't have you bother with
another word. This was to be your holiday and your
amusement, this visit to Valfreyne, and you have been
cooped up in the house working as if at home."</p>

<p>The Duke looked extremely stern at luncheon and
was punctiliously polite to everyone, but those in his
immediate vicinity were conscious that a stiffness had
fallen upon the atmosphere which asphyxiated conversation.</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine was well acquainted with the
signs of all his moods. This one, she knew, resulted
from pain of some sort, and mental perturbation. What
had occurred between him and Katherine? Could they
have quarrelled? This must be ascertained at the
earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>After luncheon they were all to motor to an old castle
for a picnic tea, a beautiful ruin of a former habitation
of the Monluces about five miles away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span></p>

<p>Katherine should go with the younger people, and
she should have the Duke to herself.</p>

<p>His manner was certainly preoccupied, and he spoke
only of ordinary things as they went through the park.</p>

<p>"The party has been the greatest success, Mordryn.
Are you pleased? Everyone has enjoyed it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose it has been all right, thanks to your
admirable qualities as hostess, dear friend. But how
irksome I find all parties! I have been too long away
from the world."</p>

<p>"I thought you seemed so cheery, Mordryn, yesterday,
but to-day you look as glum as a church. You
must shake yourself up, nothing is so foolish as giving
way to these acquired habits of solitude and separation
from your kind."</p>

<p>"I am growing old, Seraphim."</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense!" Her Ladyship cried. "You
have never looked more vigorous&mdash;or more attractive,
and you are not subject to liver attacks or the gout&mdash;so
you have no excuse in the world for this doleful point
of view."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not&mdash;It is stupid to want the moon."</p>

<p>"There are no such things as moons for Dukes; they
are always lamps which can be secured in the hand."</p>

<p>"Not without fear of combustion or fusing as the
case might be."</p>

<p>"Nothing venture nothing have. No man ought to
sit down and abandon his moon chase&mdash;if he wants it
badly enough he will get it."</p>

<p>"In spite of his conscience?"</p>

<p>Her Ladyship looked at him shrewdly&mdash;now was a
moment for indicating her sentiments she felt&mdash;he might
understand her as he so pleased.</p>

<p>"No, never in spite of his conscience, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
spite of custom or tradition or any other man-made
barrier."</p>

<p>But although the Duke found much comfort in her
words, he was not easily influenced by anyone and
the torrent of his passion had not yet reached the floodgates,
and was restrained by his will. So he turned
the conversation and endeavoured to be cheerful. And
Seraphim saw that for the moment she must leave
things to fate.</p>

<p>Katherine looked quite lovely at tea. Her new air
of rather pensive gentleness suited her well. She
showed perfect composure, there was no trace of nervousness
or self-consciousness in her manner, only her
eyes were sad.</p>

<p>What dignity, the Duke thought as he watched, her
conduct and attitude during the whole visit had shown!
He knew it must have been a moment of exceptional
excitement to her to come there among his and Lady
Garribardine's friends, as one of them, and yet not for
a second had she shown anything but composure and
ease, talking with quiet politeness to whoever addressed
her, neither with subservience nor with expansiveness,
but with exactly the consideration which so becomes a
great lady, even if she is but a girl. He looked at her
again and again, and could find only something further
to respect and admire.</p>

<p>He wondered how much she was feeling? What had
that little sob meant? Pain as well as understanding
assuredly. Was she, too, longing secretly to be taken
into his arms&mdash;as with every fibre of his being he was
burning with desire to hold her? Or did she not really
care, and was the attention of young Westonborough
enough to divert her&mdash;and would she eventually marry
Sir John?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p>This last thought was disgusting! but His Grace of
Mordryn had not the type of mind like that of Gerard
Strobridge, to take comfort in the thought that if she
did so, his own chance of future joy would be the greater.
No touch of anything but reverence was in his
heart towards Katherine.</p>

<p>And so the afternoon passed with much suffering in
two souls, and the rainbow tints of the evening came
over the sky. The chestnut trees were the softest fresh
green, and the oaks only just out. Copper beeches
and limes and firs all added to the beauty of tint. And
young birds were twittering their good-nights; the
whole world was full of love, and springtime promise of
joy.</p>

<p>And Mordryn battled with himself and banished
temptation, and had his sitting-room blinds drawn immediately
to hide all these sweet things of nature, when
they returned, and stayed alone there until it was time
to dress for dinner, saying he had important letters
to write.</p>

<p>But all the while he was conscious that just beyond
that door and that passage, there was a woman who
seemed to matter to him more than anything else in
life!</p>

<p>The whole afternoon had been such a wretched
tantalization. A long duty when he had spoken as an
automaton to boring guests. He had not sought to
talk to Katherine; that good-bye in the morning had
been final, there could be no anticlimax, that would
make it all futile.</p>

<p>And she had <i>understood</i>, she had realised his motive&mdash;this
he knew and felt, but took no comfort from the
thought.</p>

<p>And Katherine, with half an hour to herself, looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
for and found that passage on page fifty-four of "Abelard
and H&eacute;loise" and she read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I remove to a distance from your person with an intention
of avoiding you as an enemy. And yet I incessantly
seek for you in my mind&mdash;I recall your image in my
memory and in such different disquietudes I betray and
contradict myself.&mdash;I hate you!&mdash;I love you! Shame
presses me on all sides. I am at this moment afraid I
should seem more indifferent than you are, and yet I am
ashamed to discover my trouble.</p></blockquote>

<p>Well&mdash;if he felt like that&mdash;what could be the end?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI</a></h2>


<p>London seemed very noisy and tumultuous to
Katherine when they returned to Berkeley
Square, and the routine of her work came almost
as a relief.</p>

<p>What would be the outcome of this visit to Valfreyne?
She could not guess. That the Duke loved
her she knew&mdash;but with what kind of love? With an
almighty passion which one day would break all barriers
and seek for fulfilment? Or with a restrained
emotion which, when the temptation of her presence
was removed, would settle down? But of what matter
really whether he loved her with the one or the other,
since both were equally forbidden and useless!</p>

<p>And she?&mdash;What were her feelings? She knew in
her heart that if she were to permit herself to indulge
in natural emotion, she could shower upon him a love
that in its white heat of devotion and passion would
make that which she had formerly given to Lord Algy
appear but a puny schoolgirl thing.</p>

<p>She must not give way to any such feelings, though;
the pain was quite bitter enough as it was&mdash;and nothing
but stern discipline of mind and an iron self-control
could make it bearable at all.</p>

<p>She felt restless during that week&mdash;on tenterhooks
to know if she should see the Duke; hot and cold as
she went into a room. But he did not come and she
heard casually that he was still at Valfreyne. And
on Saturday morning they went down to Blissington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
until the Monday afternoon, as was their custom at
each week-end.</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine watched Katherine critically and
knew that she was suffering, and so she was unusually
kind and witty and sarcastic, and acted as a tonic.
She had a shrewd way of looking at men and things
which always delighted Katherine, and they seemed to
grow closer friends than ever.</p>

<p>"You are a great comfort to me, girl," she said. "I
can talk to you and air all my notions as I could to a
man&mdash;and you do not answer upon another subject.
For you know, my dear, that if the basis of your argument
with nine women out of ten happens to be that the
sea is salt, they will reply that on the contrary the
moon is made of green cheese! You mildly protest that
it is the taste of the sea, not the composition of the
moon which is in question, and then they say they
totally disagree with you and that the sun is warm!
You are done!&mdash;There is nothing left for you but to
smile and talk of clothes!"</p>

<p>Katherine laughed delightedly. How well she knew
this style of argument! Matilda had always practised
it.</p>

<p>"I believe I owe to my dear lady the faculty of seeing
a little differently."</p>

<p>"Not at all!&mdash;You always were as sharp as a needle.
I may merely have encouraged you perhaps."</p>

<p>"It is through your kindness and sympathy that I
have emerged and broken away from the stultifying
bonds of my class. Oh! if you only knew how deep is
my gratitude!"</p>

<p>She was very seldom moved like this, and Lady Garribardine
looked at her closely.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, child&mdash;you were made for great things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
and it is because I realised this at once, almost, that
I have sympathised with you. I could not have kept
you back any more than I could have created qualities
in you. I could merely have delayed your upward progress
or, as I hope I have done, advanced it. The spirit
in you is God-given and I have nothing to do with it."</p>

<p>Katherine's eyes softened with love and reverence!
Her dear, dear friend and benefactress!</p>

<p>When she was alone, Lady Garribardine thought
deeply over everything, their respect and affection were
mutual. It troubled her a little to see the girl so quiet&mdash;Mordryn
had played quite fairly, she hoped&mdash;but
yes&mdash;he could never do otherwise. She guessed what
was the reason of the estrangement&mdash;if estrangement
there was&mdash;on his side, and it caused her no permanent
concern.</p>

<p>"When a man feels as Mordryn feels, no class prejudice
in the world will keep him from the woman in the
end! Only let him suffer enough and then give them
an opportunity to meet, and all will be well!"</p>

<p>Thus she mused&mdash;And what a weight off her mind
it would be to see them happily married! So that her
conscience might be at rest, and she could feel that
she had more than made up for her action of long ago.
Yes&mdash;Katherine Bush was a peerless creature, and
would be the brightest jewel in any crown. Not a trace
of the jealousy or antagonism, which once or twice for
the fraction of a second had sprung up from natural
hereditary instinct and class prejudice, remained in
her heart. Her clear and wise judgment had sifted
and weighed all the pros and cons. No two human
beings on earth were more suited to one another than
her humble secretary from Bindon's Green and this
great nobleman. And she could launch Katherine suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>cessfully,
and make her accepted without question. And
after the marriage, she could safely leave to the girl's
own superb tact and common sense the task of maintaining
the position of Duchess with illustrious distinction.
So that the only barrier left to be overcome
was Mordryn's tiresome prejudice about class. That
most annoyingly obstinate sense of duty, and <i>noblesse
oblige</i>&mdash;duty to his rank and to his race. But his mind
was not narrow, and once he could have time freely to
think out what real nobility meant, he would realise
that highness of birth was not essential at all.</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine knew the Duke's nature so well;
she was aware that if she spoke to him upon this subject
and sought to influence him more than her speech
at the picnic had already done, his desire being so
forcibly upon her side, he would then still more determinedly
make up his mind not to be convinced from
the fear that he was allowing inclination to weaken his
sense of duty.</p>

<p>To leave fate to manage matters was the best plan,
and to be ready to give a helping hand at the critical
moment.</p>

<p>Mordryn was certainly suffering deeply or he would
have returned to London, instead of staying on at
Valfreyne.</p>

<p>Not by word or insinuation did she ever indicate to
Katherine that she had remarked the Duke's interest in
her, or the apparent cooling of it. Indeed, since that
day at the Easter party when she had lightly spoken
of his coming to the schoolroom, she had never mentioned
him to her secretary in connection with herself
at all. So on the surface everything was calm and
peaceful, and life flowed in its accustomed stream.</p>

<p>Mordryn must be made to come to Berkeley Square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
again as of old, and he must not be allowed to see Katherine
for some time. He must get into the way of dropping
in as usual without fear.</p>

<p>And in the third week after Whitsuntide, the Duke
returned to town and did dine there, and Miss Bush
was nowhere to be seen. He had spent very miserable
days down in his beautiful home. He had not reached
the stage of reason yet, he was merely fighting desire
with all his might&mdash;while daily it grew stronger.</p>

<p>How cold her hand had been when they had said a
polite good-bye on the Tuesday morning; he could feel
it through the glove! How pale her face had looked,
too! He hoped to God she was not suffering; that
would be too cruel, and he could not feel guiltless if it
were so. He had certainly played upon her feelings,
although in the most subtle manner, which made his
conduct the more cowardly and inexcusable. This
thought brought extreme discomfort, and plunged him
into frantic work. He filled all his hours with the business
of his estate, in order to banish memory, but with
no great success, so at last he came up to London, determined
to crush out every weakness. But when he
went to Berkeley Square to dine he felt agitated, and
he knew that he was fearing and yet hoping to see
Katherine.</p>

<p>But he caught no glimpse of her, nor was she even
mentioned, it was as though she had never been. He
grew anxious&mdash;had she left Seraphim's service? This
must be ascertained immediately, before he left the
house.</p>

<p>"Miss Bush is not dining to-night, Seraphim?" he
said, after dinner, when he had a moment with his
hostess. "I hope she is well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thanks," and Her Ladyship turned the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>versation
at once, so that he was left with this meagre
information.</p>

<p>As he drove away to St. James's, he found himself
thinking incessantly of the girl.</p>

<p>She had understood. She was so fine, she had grasped
the situation completely&mdash;had she not herself explained
to him the duty he owed to his race?</p>

<p>But a woman who could take such an abstract view
must surely have a very wonderful soul! Every one
of her ideas had shown the highest sense of duty, the
most profound grasp of what was meant by <i>noblesse
oblige</i>. He remembered even her remark about his attending
the House of Lords, how she had said it was
cowardly of him to shirk his work there just because
he so despised modern views. In what high esteem, too,
she was held by Seraphim&mdash;a woman not to be imposed
upon by any mere charm, and one who would bring the
most critical judgment to bear upon every question
before she would accord her friendship.&mdash;And that
Katherine had Lady Garribardine's friendship in full,
he knew.</p>

<p>He went into his library which looked out on the
Green Park, and he opened the window side and walked
on to the terrace. In the distance the roar of Piccadilly
thundered by, but his immediate neighbourhood
was quiet and he could think.</p>

<p>He reviewed every minute incident from the beginning
of his acquaintance with Katherine that night not so
very long ago at the house of Gerard Strobridge. She
had admitted that it was she herself who had desired
this meeting after she had heard him speak. That
proved that she had been drawn to him even then. And
how attractive she had appeared, how cultivated and
polished, how clever and refined! And to think that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
such achievement was the result of steadfastness of
purpose! A will to compass an ideal against extraordinary
odds. An intelligence great enough to realise
that facts alone count, and that no assumption of the
rights of ladyhood, or demonstration in words, would
convince anyone, but only the inward reality of fineness
of soul directing outward action. How much more
meritorious and to be respected was her achievement
then than if these things had been her natural heritage!
She had obtained a state of perfection through
deliberate intention in a far greater degree than anyone
he knew but Seraphim. Her every idea, thought,
expression and point of view, accorded exactly with
his own. Her sense of duty was paramount. Her
level-headedness, and her common sense, and her balance
were such as he had never before seen in woman.</p>

<p>And she was young and beautiful, and in perfect
health. No nervous fancies beset that evenly poised
brain.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as he stared up into the deep blue starlit
sky, it seemed that the scales fell from his eyes, and
fog was lifted from his inner vision of the soul.</p>

<p>This beloved creature&mdash;daughter of an auctioneer
and granddaughter of a butcher&mdash;was truly and really
an aristocrat in the purest and truest sense of the
term. And just because he could trace his pedigree
back for countless generations, who was he to stand
aside and not give her her due when her spirit and
character were so infinitely above him? (Thus love
engenders humility in noble hearts!)</p>

<p>Where in the whole world could he find one so worthy
to share his great name and great estate? He laughed
aloud in glee! It would not be giving way to temptation
for personal joy to think of her as his Duchess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
but it would be conferring the greatest honour upon
his house that it had ever known.</p>

<p>He marvelled at his blindness&mdash;marvelled at his
pitifully conventional point of view. How had it ever
weighed with him a second? How had he not realised
at once the utter paltriness of the designation of aristocrat
unless the inner being carries out what that word
is intended to convey?</p>

<p>He thought of his wife Laura, with her stupid, mean
little brain, developing into madness. He thought of
Gerard's wife Beatrice&mdash;of what use was she to any
man? He thought of his own cousin, Dulcie Dashington,
with her vulgar barmaid's instincts, and her degradation
of her great state, and he thought of all the
crew of frivolous, soulless, mindless worldlings who had
flung themselves at his head at Blissington, any one of
whom society would call a well-bred lady suitable for
him to marry and take to his home!</p>

<p>And then he thought of Katherine's simple dignity.
She had not tried to entrap him. She had not been
insulted at his holding back, she had understood. In
her humility of greatness, she had <i>understood</i> what
would be likely to be his view&mdash;or rather the view of his
class.</p>

<p>But now he saw the truth, and the truth was that
she stood out a star among womankind and none other
was worthy to tie the latchet of her shoe.</p>

<p>He would not hesitate another second. He would
telephone in the morning to Seraphim and propose himself
for Saturday, and then he should see her&mdash;this
sweet Katherine&mdash;and talk to her and tell her the truth.
And if she would so honour him then she should be his
own.</p>

<p>The vision exalted him. He let his imagination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
curbed and denied expression for so long, have full
rein. She was not cold by nature, she would not have
to simulate passion like Julia Scarrisbrooke! Hers, if
she felt it at all, would be real. She had experienced
that part of love before. He even thought of this without
a pang, for that was past&mdash;and something told
him that she was not indifferent to him now. How
enchanting to make her really love him&mdash;how divine to
teach her all the shades of that "something beyond"
which she had asked him about!</p>

<p>And then their life together there at Valfreyne! Yes,
this was the true kind of strength which she had spoken
of, the strength which breaks down all shams.</p>

<p>And to think how near he had been to allowing the
stupid, blind, hypocritical ideas of his world to part
them forever! He must have been mad, since he had
known her worth always, from the first day. Seraphim
would help him after all&mdash;had she not told him not to
go against his conscience, but only against custom and
tradition and any other man-made barrier? And now
conscience was with him, and he would break every bar
which divided him from his heart's delight!</p>

<p>Lady Garribardine's surprise was great on receiving
the telephone message in the morning: Might His Grace
speak to Her Ladyship personally?</p>

<p>Katherine repeated the message of the servant.</p>

<p>Certainly His Grace might.</p>

<p>Katherine handed the receiver and was preparing to
leave the room, but Lady Garribardine made a sign
for her to stay while she sat up in bed.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Mordryn&mdash;Oh!&mdash;Why, of course you
may come down to-morrow! Yes&mdash;London is hot. It
will only be a dull party&mdash;Gwendoline and the Colvins
and old Tom Hawthorne. I was merely going for rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
myself. You don't mind, you would like that?&mdash;Oh!
very well, come either by motor or the three o'clock
train. All right&mdash;good-bye."</p>

<p>Then she looked at Katherine who met her eyes with
a perfectly unmoved face.</p>

<p>"The Duke proposes himself to come to us to-morrow
at Blissington, he is bored with London, and out
of sorts."</p>

<p>But no joy appeared on the secretary's countenance;
in fact she turned a shade paler, as she asked
if she should transmit any orders to the housekeeper
about his room.</p>

<p>"She feels things like the devil," Her Ladyship
thought. "But Mordryn has evidently come to his
senses, so they will presently settle the matter all
right."</p>

<p>Katherine was glad that her duties now took her out
shopping, she felt she must be in the open air and free
to think.</p>

<p>What did this mean? Why was he coming to Blissington
so suddenly? Would it produce a climax in her
fate?</p>

<p>And as Mordryn had done the night before on his
terrace overlooking the Green Park, so she too reviewed
all their acquaintance and what it had grown
to mean to her&mdash;something very bitter sweet.</p>

<p>Should she allow herself a fool's paradise for just a
day? Should she let him make love to her, if that was
his intention in coming to Blissington? But no, she
must be firm with herself and act always as she thought
right. But her mind was in a turmoil, and she felt
tired and excited. The picture held out nothing but
pain.</p>

<p>If he came and made love to her, she would have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
cut his protestations short. And if he ignored her,
that would hurt still more. She devoutly wished she
might run away.</p>

<p>At luncheon the next day, after their arrival at
Blissington, Her Ladyship said rather irrelevantly:</p>

<p>"You look thoroughly tired out, girl. I advise you
to take a rug and a book and go out under the chestnut
trees in the beautiful air, and have a nap&mdash;and don't
come in for tea if you do not want to, there are so few
of us I can manage by myself."</p>

<p>And Katherine, glad to escape, did as she was bid.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII</a></h2>


<p>When the Duke arrived by motor, tea had just
been brought out on the terrace at the eastern
side of the house. His glance travelled
rapidly over the group. Miss Bush was not present.</p>

<p>His impatience had been growing and growing ever
since the Thursday night when his resolution had been
taken, and now he almost felt like a boy in his great
disappointment at noting Katherine's absence.</p>

<p>How was he going to talk to the Colvins and Tom
Hawthorne and old Gwendoline! However, he did manage
to be almost his usual self, though Lady Garribardine
was quite aware that his nerves were strung
to a high tension.</p>

<p>She got through tea as quickly as possible, and then
walked him off to see a new set of herbaceous borders.</p>

<p>The very second that they were alone, Mordryn began
to talk openly to her. He had determined to have
no further cross purposes of any kind.</p>

<p>"Do you guess, Seraphim, what has brought me
here to-day?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I have some shrewd idea&mdash;you have decided to appreciate
reality and discard appearance, as my Katherine
Bush would say."</p>

<p>"That is it. Have I your sympathy, dear friend?"</p>

<p>"My warmest sympathy, Mordryn; your happiness
means a very great deal to me. I have had some horrible
moments in those past years, of remorse for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
part in your sorrows&mdash;but if you secure this girl, I
can feel that you will be amply compensated."</p>

<p>"I am deeply in love, Seraphim, and you, I know,
will not laugh at me, or think it absurd."</p>

<p>She gave him a frank smile full of affection.</p>

<p>"Indeed, no&mdash;and what is more important, the girl
will not laugh either. She is full of passion, Mordryn&mdash;have
you ever watched her little nostrils quiver? You
will have no colourless time with her! She is not of
the type of poor L&auml;o Delemar, Gerard's friend, or
Julia Scarrisbrooke! The fierce red blood rushes
through her veins!&mdash;But she is too entirely self-controlled
to let even me see what her real feelings are,
though I shrewdly suspect she is in love with you&mdash;You,
the man, Mordryn&mdash;and not, strange to say, the Dukedom
at all!"</p>

<p>His Grace thrilled with delight&mdash;as why not, indeed!
Of all beautiful and maligned things, he knew real passion
was the rarest!</p>

<p>"If it had been the Dukedom, she could have tantalized
me into committing any madness&mdash;weeks ago&mdash;but
she has done nothing of the sort. She has simply
<i>understood</i>, that is the wonderful part."</p>

<p>"She is an amazing creature, a wonderful character,
old friend&mdash;perfectly honest and intensely proud. Not
with the pride which sticks its chin in the air, but that
which carries the head high; there is all the difference
in the world between the two. Upstarts nearly always
have their chins in the air, but are unacquainted with
the other attitude. She will make the most perfect
Duchess your house has ever known&mdash;And think of your
children!"</p>

<p>The Duke drew in his breath sharply, a new joy permeated
him at her words&mdash;"Just think of your chil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>dren!
Why, my dream of the six sturdy boys may
yet come true!"</p>

<p>"Seraphim&mdash;really!"</p>

<p>Her ladyship chuckled happily. "Now we must use
common sense; there must not be a flaw in the whole
affair. If she agrees to marry you, I will begin to
arrange the situation at once. I will bring her out
more and present her to people&mdash;and we will not announce
the engagement for a few weeks. No one will
dare to question who she is, or where she came from if
I choose to do that. Some of them may even suggest
that she is the result of some past indiscretion of one
of the family that I have adopted. They may think
what they like! She is so absolutely honest, she would
tell anyone the truth herself without a care&mdash;but I
think I shall advise her to be silent, and let people make
up what they please. No one can dispute her perfect
refinement or suitability to take any position in the
world."</p>

<p>"Seraphim, you are an angel."</p>

<p>"No, I am not&mdash;I am merely a capable craftsman.
I like to do everything I undertake well. Your Duchess
shall start unhandicapped."</p>

<p>"How deep is my gratitude, dear friend!"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!"</p>

<p>But her dark eyes beamed mistily. "When I see you
safely off&mdash;with the knot tied, on your way to Valfreyne
for the honeymoon&mdash;I shall feel content."</p>

<p>"Where is she?"</p>

<p>"I told her to go and rest under the chestnuts this
afternoon. She looked as pale as a ghost."</p>

<p>"May I find her there, then, now?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;be off! And bless you!"</p>

<p>They wrung hands, and the Duke strode away look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>ing,
as Her Ladyship admitted, with a fond half-sigh,
still the hero of any woman's dream. His years sat so
lightly upon him.</p>

<p>But he searched under the chestnuts and beyond, and
Katherine was nowhere to be seen. A rug was folded
beneath one great trunk&mdash;she had evidently been there,
and had now wandered on and perhaps was not far off.</p>

<p>He continued his search for some time without success,
and when he reached the edge of the near woods,
with their beautiful paths, some of which ran down to
a bit of ornamental water just big enough to be called
a lake, he stopped, puzzled as to which one to follow.
His heart was beating as it had not beat for years.
He decided to go straight to the water's edge to a Chinese
tea-house which was there, and when he came at
length in sight of this, he perceived the flutter of a
grey linen skirt disappearing round the corner of it&mdash;On
the verandah which overhung the water, there were
great white water lilies growing in masses just beneath,
while two stately swans swam about in the distance;
the sun was sinking, it was past six o'clock; and the
lights were very lovely and all was serene and still.</p>

<p>His footfalls did not sound on the soft turf, and
Katherine did not know of his approach until he actually
stood before her on the broad verandah step.</p>

<p>She was leaning against the balustrade gazing out
over the lake, and she turned and caught sight of him.</p>

<p>He came forward with outstretched hands, his face
aglow.</p>

<p>"So I have found you at last!" he cried, gladly.
"What made you hide away here all alone?"</p>

<p>Katherine controlled herself sternly. She shook
hands calmly, saying it was cool by the water and a
pleasant place to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p>"Solitude is good sometimes."</p>

<p>She had felt too restless to stay beneath the trees&mdash;even
her will could not keep her disturbed thoughts
from speculation as to what the day might bring. And
now the Duke was here beside her, and the situation
must be faced.</p>

<p>He came close and leaned upon the quaint wooden
rails trying to look down into her averted face, while
he whispered:</p>

<p>"I had rather enjoy a <i>solitude &agrave; deux</i>."</p>

<p>He saw that she was pale and that her manner was
restrained. Did she possibly misunderstand the purpose
of his coming?</p>

<p>"Look," and she pointed over to the swans&mdash;"they
perhaps agree with you&mdash;they swim lazily about together,
dignified and composed, far from turmoil and
agitating currents. One envies the birds and beasts
and fishes&mdash;sometimes," and she sighed.</p>

<p>"You must not sigh&mdash;look at me, Katherine. I want
to see your eyes."</p>

<p>But she disobeyed him and turned the broad lids
down. He leaned closer still, and this caused a wave
of emotion to sweep over her, producing the same feeling
which she had once thought only Lord Algy in all
the world could evoke in her&mdash;so that the Duke saw
those little nostrils quiver, which his friend Seraphim
had spoken to him about, and the sight gave him great
joy.</p>

<p>"Look at me, Katherine!" and now his voice was full
of command.</p>

<p>Then she slowly raised her gray-green eyes and he
saw that they were troubled, in spite of the passion
that lay in their depths.</p>

<p>"Why do you come here and speak to me like this?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
and in her voice there was reproach. "We said farewell
at Valfreyne&mdash;that was the end&mdash;I understood&mdash;Why
do you come again to trouble me now?"</p>

<p>"Because I could not keep away&mdash;because I love you,
darling child."</p>

<p>She drew back, shivering with the pain of the struggle
which was developing in her soul.</p>

<p>"Hush, you must not say that to me, I ask you not
to, please."</p>

<p>But since coldness and repulsion were not what he
read in her glance, her words did not discourage him.</p>

<p>"I was very foolish at Valfreyne, Katherine, ever to
have said farewell, but now I have come here to Blissington
to tell you that I love you passionately, my
darling, and your dear sympathy and understanding
saw into my mind, and grasped the prejudices therein.
But now the blindness has fallen from my eyes&mdash;I adore
you, my Beloved One&mdash;Katherine, I want you to be my
wife."</p>

<p>His voice had never been more beautiful. His splendid
presence had never appeared more impressive, nor
the fascination of the man more supreme. And he was
there, a suppliant before her asking her to be his
wife!</p>

<p>For a few seconds her brain reeled. The summit
of her ambition was reached&mdash;and not ambition alone,
but what now seemed to matter more, the realisation of
true love. Both were there for her to take and to
enjoy. The fateful moment had come. She was face
to face with the great problem of her life. How could
she relinquish all this glory, just to keep faith with her
ideal of right?</p>

<p>She looked up into his proud face and saw it transfigured
with worship, and she gave a little cry&mdash;No,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
she could never deceive him, he was far too fine for
that. Whatever came, between them there should be
only truth. But even so, a flood of passionate emotion
burst all bonds, the whole deep currents of her nature
were stirred, and must find vent before the final renunciation.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she cried, and let herself be clasped in his
embrace, then, "I love you, I love you!" she went on
wildly.&mdash;"Kiss me&mdash;hold me, let me feel what it is like
to be there next your heart&mdash;what it would mean&mdash;what
it <i>could</i> mean, if it might only be.&mdash;Oh! you do
not know what it costs really to say good-bye&mdash;Do
you remember once when I told you that I knew one
side of love and asked you if there was not something
beyond? Well, I know now that there is&mdash;you have
taught me to feel it&mdash;It is the soul's victory&mdash;I love
you with everything in me, with my body and my spirit
and my life!"</p>

<p>But she could articulate no further, for the Duke,
intoxicated with emotion, strained her to his heart,
bruising her lips with kisses which seemed to transport
them both to paradise.</p>

<p>Here was no timid lover! But one with a nature as
fiercely passionate as her own!</p>

<p>"Ah, God, how divine!" and he sighed when at last
after long, blissful seconds his lips left hers. "Katherine,
how dare you talk such folly to me of bidding me
good-bye! You shall never leave me again, you are
absolutely mine."</p>

<p>"Hush!" and she put her hand over his mouth tenderly,
while she drew herself out of his arms. "As far
as love goes I am indeed all yours, the mightiness of
this passion has swept away all other thoughts, but
now you will have to listen to me&mdash;and you must not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
speak until the end.&mdash;See, let us sit here for the story is
long."</p>

<p>Just to humour her he allowed her to draw him to
the seat, and with eyes devouring her with fond impatience,
he waited for her to begin.</p>

<p>"Promise that you will not interrupt me until I have
finished, no matter what you may feel or think."</p>

<p>He gave his word quite gaily and took and held her
hand.</p>

<p>Katherine controlled her every nerve now and told
the story in a deep, quiet voice&mdash;with no dramatic gestures,
drawing a graphic picture of her home and of
the office at Liv and Dev's and the effect upon her of
the voices of the gentlemen who came to borrow money.
And then she told of the coming of Lord Algy and of
their acquaintance, and then she paused for a second
and glanced at Mordryn's face. It had grown a little
strained, but he grasped more tightly her hand.</p>

<p>"Now you must listen very carefully and try to
understand. I suppose I must have been in love with
him in a passionate kind of way, he was so very handsome
and gay and full of charm&mdash;Well, I decided to go
away with him for three days&mdash;I decided deliberately,
not so much from love as because I wanted to understand
life, and to know the nature of men, and the
point of view of an aristocrat."</p>

<p>The Duke's face became ashen white and his hand
turned icy cold, but he did not speak. So with a little
break in her voice, Katherine went on:</p>

<p>"&mdash;Well, we went to Paris on the Saturday and came
back on the Monday night; by that time I knew all the
passionate side of love; he aroused all those instincts in
me which I once told you about&mdash;but he never touched
my soul&mdash;that slept until you came.&mdash;I never meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
to stay with him or remain his mistress; it was for
experience, and that was all&mdash;and we parted at Charing
Cross Station, and he went to Wales to his family
to shoot, and I went home. I wrote to him and told
him that I would not see him again. Then I made up
my mind that I would leave Livingstone &amp; Devereux's,
and begin my next rise in the world. Oh! you do not
know how ignorant I was then! But I never lost sight
of the goal I meant to win, to win by knowing how to
fill the position desired. I had vast dreams even in
those early days. I was fortunate to obtain the situation
of Lady Garribardine's secretary, and on leaving
the house after being engaged, I met Lord Algy
by chance in the park. He was very much upset and
unhappy at my determination never to see him again&mdash;and
he asked me to marry him. I refused, of course,
because I knew even then that he only attracted one
side of me, and also I was not educated enough at that
time to have been able to carry off the position with
success. I explained everything to him, and made him
promise to try and be a fine soldier&mdash;he was being sent
to Egypt for his extravagance, and so we parted, and
I have never spoken to him since. My goal now was
definitely fixed; I meant to educate myself to be able
to take the highest position to be obtained in England
some day. I used to long for Algy sometimes, but only
every now and then, when some scent or sound brought
him back to me; that is why I said such love is unbalanced
and animal&mdash;the memory of it is always aroused
by something of the senses. Then, after I went to Lady
Garribardine, Mr. Strobridge came upon the scene,
and his great cultivation inspired me, and presently
we became friends. I deliberately encouraged his friendship
so as to polish my own brain. I knew he was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
love with me, so this may have been wrong, but since
he was weak enough to allow himself to feel in that way
for me knowing he was married, he must pay the price
in pain, not I. He has always been a loyal friend after
the beginning, when he lost his head one night and made
a great scene. My determination never wavered; it
was in every way to improve myself, always to be perfectly
true and finally to obtain the height of my ambition.
Things went on in this way for a year and a half,
Lady Garribardine always helping me and encouraging
my education until we became deep and intimate
friends. But the goal never seemed to come in view
until I went to the House of Lords that day and saw
you and heard you speak. In a lightning flash the object
of all my striving seemed revealed to me, and I
began to lay my plans, but with some unusual excitement,
because something in you had aroused an emotion
in my heart, the meaning of which I could not then
determine. That night I went to the theatre with my
sister and there saw in the stalls Lord Algy, returned
from Egypt, I suppose, on leave. The sight of him
moved me, I felt cold and sick, but I realised once for
all that my feeling for him had been only physical, and
was passing away.</p>

<p>"I had arranged with Mr. Strobridge to have the
dinner, and to let me meet you, not as the secretary,
because I knew that your unconscious prejudice would
be insurmountable then. And I thought that if you
liked me that night, afterwards the prejudice might not
be so deep when you did know my real position.&mdash;You
will remember what followed, but the second part of
the story begins with the afternoon you came into the
schoolroom. Until then I had never had a backward
thought or regret or worry about Lord Algy. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
only glad to have had the experience, that was all. But
after I had told you of my life and parentage, you
bent down and kissed my hand. And from that moment
doubts began to trouble me. You had started the awakening
of my soul. And as love grew and grew, so the
blackness of the shadow increased. I knew that if I deceived
you I should only draw unhappiness and never
respect myself. Where love is there can be no deceit&mdash;and
so at last even before I went to Valfreyne I put
all thoughts of you from me. Although each day you
seemed to grow more dear&mdash;until I knew that you
meant everything to me and were my wild and passionate
desire&mdash;I saw that my position in life held you
back, and I was almost glad that it should be so&mdash;because
I knew that if you should really love me, and
conquer your prejudice against my class, it would
come to this, that I must tell you the truth and that it
would part us forever. And I have tried to prevent
you from telling me of your love, I have tried to restrain
my own for you, but now I am left defenceless&mdash;I
love you, but I realise that what I did in the past
the world could never forgive, and so I must pay the
price of my own action, and say an eternal farewell."</p>

<p>Her voice died away in a sob, and she did not then
look at the Duke's face; his hand had grown nerveless
in its clasp and she drew hers away from him, and rose
slowly to her feet. The awful moment was over, the
story was done&mdash;she had been true to herself and had
lost her love&mdash;and now she must have courage to behave
with dignity and go back to the house.</p>

<p>But she must just look at him once more, her dearly
loved one! He sat there in an attitude of utter dejection,
his face buried in his hands.&mdash;For long aching
moments Katherine watched him, but she did not speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
and life and hope and purpose died out of her, drowned
in overwhelming grief.</p>

<p>Then after this horrible silence the blood seemed to
creep back to the Duke's heart, and reaction set in.
He began gradually to think. His level judgment, his
faculty for analyzing things, reasserted themselves, and
enabled him to view the whole subject in right perspective,
and a re-awakening to happiness slowly filled him.</p>

<p>He looked up to Katherine at last as she stood there
leaning against a pillar of the balustrade, and he read
no humiliation or shame or contrition in her great eyes,
but only a deep sorrow and tenderness and love.</p>

<p>And suddenly he realised the splendour of her courage,
the glorious force of character which had enabled
her to jeopardize&mdash;nay, indeed, relinquish, love and
high estate and ambition, rather than be false to herself.</p>

<p><i>For she need not have told him anything of her story.</i>
That fact was the great proof of her truth. He had
asked no questions about her past. She had made no
dramatic virtue of necessity, she had done this thing
that she might not soil her own soul with deceit.</p>

<p>Of what matter was a paltry venial sin! If sin it
were, the shame of which lay wholly in a too rigid convention&mdash;of
what matter to him were three days in
the past, long before they had met! That she was altogether
his now in body and soul he had no faintest
doubt. Was there any man living such a fool or puritan
that he would renounce life's joy for such a foolish
thing! The very qualities of courage and justice which
her action in telling him had shown, would wipe out
any sin and give him ample guaranties for future security
and peace. Such a woman was worth all the
world! And ridiculous puny conventions were of no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
account. Did he dream of looking upon Seraphim as
degraded because she had been his love long ago, and
not his wife? Of course not! Then why should he feel
scorn for Katherine who had not even betrayed a husband,
but had been free? Scorn was for such women
as Julia Scarrisbrooke&mdash;creatures who simulated passion
for one man after another, merely as a game&mdash;people
who held love cheaply and who knew not even
the glimmerings of obligation to their own souls.</p>

<p>Away with all shams of the world! None of them
should influence him! He had found a spirit strong
and free and honest. Reality had won forever, and
appearance had vanished away.</p>

<p>So he rose and came to her again and once more took
her into his arms, and bending kissed her white forehead
as if in blessing.</p>

<p>"Oh! my Beloved&mdash;And you deemed that this would
part us, this long-past ugly thing! Foolish one!&mdash;You
do not know how much I love you! Far beyond
any of the earthly things. Darling, I honour your
brave courage. I worship your truth. You shall come
to me and be my adored wife, and the mistress of my
home. Katherine, heart of me, whisper that all sorrows
are over, and let us enter heaven together and
forget all else."</p>

<p>But Katherine, overwrought with emotion, lay there
against his breast, limp and white. She was beyond
speech, only her spirit cried out in thankfulness to
God for having given her the strength to tell the truth.</p>

<p>Joys kills not&mdash;and soon under her lover's fond
caresses, warm life rushed back to her. And thus in
the evening glory of sunset they found content.</p>

<p>For the one sublime thing in this sad, mad world is
LOVE.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII</a></h2>


<p>It was more than a month since, in the late July of
1914, the joy bells had rung out on all the Duke's
estates for the birth of the heir, the infant Marquis
of Valfreyne. And it was just a year since Katherine
had become his Duchess!</p>

<p>And what a year in a woman's life!</p>

<p>Days and weeks and months of happiness, of ever-increasing
understanding and companionship, with one
whose every action and thought inspired respect and
love.</p>

<p>The bond between the two had grown always more
deep, more sacred, as the days went on, and as Katherine
said one morning fondly:</p>

<p>"Mordryn, we are just like <i>Rochester</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i>,
not modern people, because we never want to be away
from one another for a minute&mdash;only, thank God, you
are not blind."</p>

<p>Theirs was a real marriage, and Lady Garribardine
was fully content. She took personal pride in the manner
in which her prot&eacute;g&eacute; fulfilled the r&ocirc;le of Duchess,
and she rejoiced to see her old love in the midst of such
bliss.</p>

<p>For their union was divine and complete, and the
coming of the baby Valfreyne had been the crowning
joy.</p>

<p>It was a continual source of delight to the Duke to
watch Katherine, and to know how absolutely his belief
in her had been justified. To watch and to note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
with what supreme dignity she carried out the duties of
his great state. And as each occasion came when some
special effort was required, after it was over she would
rush into his arms, and caress him, and ask to be petted,
and told that he was satisfied, and that his beggar
Duchess had pleased him and done all that he would
wish!</p>

<p>The year of perfect happiness and gratified ambition
had moulded Katherine into a new and noble being, in
whom graciousness and sweetness and gentleness enhanced
all her old charms.</p>

<p>She continued to make Lady Garribardine her model
for everything.</p>

<p>The world had experienced a nine days' wonder
when the engagement was announced; but, as Her
Ladyship said, there was no use in having kept her
iron heel upon the neck of society for all these years,
if she could not now impose upon it unquestioned what
she wished. So Katherine had had a triumphant entry,
and very little antagonism to surmount. She paid visits
to all the Duke's relatives under Lady Garribardine's
wing, and her own tact and serene dignity had conquered
them all, and turned them into friends.</p>

<p>"She is of no particular birth," Her Ladyship was
wont to say, "but <i>I know</i> who she is, so you need none
of you trouble yourselves about it. I will be answerable
for her fitness for the post."</p>

<p>Thus the most romantic and fantastic rumours got
about, and Lady Garribardine wrote amusedly to
Gerard in Russia, after the wedding in September, giving
a description of events:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I issued stern commands to Bronson, G., that there
should be no talk below stairs, no gratifying of anybody's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
curiosity, and I think I can count upon their devotion to
me, and their great liking for the girl herself, to feel that
they will co&ouml;perate. Her family were the entertaining
thing. The sisters from America wrote sensible letters,
realising that the great divide had come, and fortunately
the Bindon's Green remainder had themselves cut her off
from their intimacy, because she was what they called a
"paid servant," "living in," apparently a degraded status
in that incredible class! Mordryn received a letter from
her sister-in-law a few days after the news was in the
papers, a most remarkable bit of feminine spite, which
caused us all glee: informing him that as he had no doubt
been sadly deceived by Katherine Bush, she felt it her
duty to enlighten him as to who she really was! Great
stress was laid upon the butcher grandfather, and regrets
that she herself had contracted an alliance so far beneath
her station, but having experienced the unpleasantness of
it, she felt it was only right to warn the Duke!</p>

<p>I myself wrote the reply as though I had been his secretary,
announcing that His Grace was in possession of
all these facts and more from Miss Bush herself, and
with due appreciation for the motive which had caused
the letter to be written, the Duke thanked her for it and
would not require to hear from her again!</p>

<p>So all that part is disposed of fortunately, and Katherine
can go ahead.</p>

<p>Mordryn is frantically in love and so is she. Mordryn
is like a boy and looks ten years younger. He showers
gifts upon her, and on the day of the wedding, when he
walked down the aisle with his beautiful new Duchess on
his arm, I never have seen a man so proud. And when
one comes to think of it, G., he has every right to be, for
I must say the creature carries out the whole thing with
a perfection which justifies my greatest expectations of
her, and I think they stand a very fair chance of happiness,
because the girl has a logical brain. She is not
one of those fools who only like the excitement of a
thing's being out of reach; she has the supreme wisdom
of a sense of intrinsic values. She realises that she has
secured a great position which will give ample scope for
her vastest schemes&mdash;all high and fine ones, G.; we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
hear of her in the future, boy, not only as a beautiful
Duchess, but as a great Englishwoman. And when one
reflects that she has accomplished all this, won her game,
so to speak, through sheer force of character, sheer knowledge
of cause and effect, sheer calculation of action and
no low scheming, one cannot but deeply respect her. Force
will always win, but it will bring its own retribution if it
has been used ill. Katherine has had the great cleverness
to use it always well. Weak virtue may draw some kind of
namby-pamby heavenly halo, but perfect honesty and
strong common sense secure power and a substantial reward
on earth! It will be very interesting to watch her
career as it goes on. She is grateful for her happiness and
knows that it is only weaklings who, once having secured
this joy, then let it be taken from them by their own foolishness
and discontent. Her whole mind is disciplined and
ruled by an astonishingly sound judgment. Impulse is her
servant, not her master; every view is broad. She sees all
things as they really are without the illusion which nearly
every woman invests them with. And, above all, she understands
Mordryn, G.&mdash;and with all her balance and level-headedness,
she is as passionate and vital and living as a
woman can be, and that is the one kind of being who keeps
a man with his temperament forever content. After his
life of restraint and abstinence and solitary grief, to have
such a creature for a companion must be no mean delight.
So altogether, G., my dear boy, I am satisfied. As for his
age, he does not look a day more than forty; they probably
will have a glorious fifteen years, and you cannot have
everything in life. He suits her far better than some
younger man, they are made for one another. Mordryn
has perfect health and strength, and no human being could
be more attractive. You have not a notion of his ways as
a lover, G.! He would be a lesson to any of these uncouth,
cold-blooded, barley-water drinking modern young men!</p>

<p>Our Duchess is a fortunate creature, I assure you, in
more ways than one! So we need not trouble about that
or make unto ourselves a picture of a young woman and
an elderly man! They are like a pair of love birds&mdash;and
they will probably have that sturdy heir at once that I have
always longed for, and then I can rest in peace.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>

<p>And when Gerard read this at Moscow, where he
happened to be, he was glad, and yet sad.</p>

<p>The wedded lovers wandered for several months in
France and Italy, returning to England only in the
new year, and all this interesting foreign travel expanded
still further Katherine's mental gifts. Then
after some triumphant weeks in London, there were
long months of joy at Valfreyne, awaiting the coming
of the son and heir.</p>

<p>And now in the early days of September, 1914, they
were all again assembled there with Lady Garribardine
for the christening&mdash;a great and important event!</p>

<p>But war and strain and sorrow lay with that black
shadow over England, fallen with a suddenness which
no one could realise as yet. Rumours of reverses had
come&mdash;miscalculation of somebody's plans. And
anxiety was tense.</p>

<p>Katherine was resting on the sofa in her boudoir,
which looked out south over the exquisite gardens in
the state suite at Valfreyne&mdash;the suite of her who should
be reigning Duchess, in which she had wandered with
the Duke on that Monday in Whitsuntide, when they
had said their futile farewell! And now it was her own!
And in an hour, they would go into the chapel and the
splendid chubby baby heir would receive his many
names.</p>

<p>Katherine felt very well and in herself supremely
happy, in spite of the clouds over England. How good
providence had been to her! How grateful her spirit
felt!</p>

<p>She lay there in a peaceful dream, her half closed
eyes taking in the wonderful beauty of the room, with
its late seventeenth century magnificence and yet
subtle touches of home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the door opened, and the Duke came in with
letters for her from the second post, and the opened
<i>Times</i> he had been reading in his hand&mdash;He put them
down upon a table near, and took a low chair close to
his lady's side, and she moved a little from the sofa so
that she lay half in his arms.</p>

<p>"My worshipped one!" he murmured fondly, kissing
her hair, and smoothing it with infinite tenderness.</p>

<p>"Oh! Mordryn, I am so happy&mdash;are not you? What
a sublime day for us, dear Love! Just to think that
we have that darling little son, the very essence of us
both! Tell me that he and I mean everything to you.
Tell me that I have given you all you want?"</p>

<p>He reassured her with passionate insistence, as
though he could not say enough, and then he asked
her again and again if she loved him. It was as if he
must have confirmation of her passion for him, and
her consent.</p>

<p>And Katherine played with him fondly as was her
wont, being altogether fascinating and full of foolish,
tender love tricks, which never failed to intoxicate his
senses.</p>

<p>But soon he held her closely to him, some shadow
in his eyes&mdash;and with his free arm he reached over to
the table and picked up the <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>Then he spoke, and his wonderful voice sounded a
little strained:</p>

<p>"My darling, there is some news in the paper this
morning, which may cause you some concern&mdash;so I
have brought it to you here while we are alone. It is
about the retreat from Mons."</p>

<p>Katherine raised herself and looked at him enquiringly,
and he found the column and began to read the
glorious story, and of one supremely splendid stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
made by a certain Guards regiment, which is now world-famed.</p>

<p>Then he paused and hesitated for a moment. For
the name of the bravest who would gain the V. C. was
Lord Algernon Fitz-Rufus who, single-handed, had
performed an act of daring courage, resourcefulness
and self-sacrifice, which had saved his men, but who
had paid with his life for his last supreme effort, being
shot through the heart as he had returned to a wounded
comrade, Lieutenant Jack Kilcourcy, to bring him in
to safety from that bloody corpse-strewn wood.</p>

<p>"What is it, Mordryn?&mdash;Please go on."</p>

<p>So the Duke read to the end, and then put the paper
down.</p>

<p>And suddenly Katherine's heart seemed to stand
still, and a mist darkened the room, and when it lifted
she saw only the young d&eacute;bonnaire face of her once dear
lover gazing at her again, her gay blue eyes alight with
laughter and love. And with a stifled cry, she buried
her head on the Duke's shoulder and burst into tears.</p>

<p>Thus Algy had fulfilled her hopes for him and become
a fine soldier, and had died gallantly to save a
comrade&mdash;A hero indeed!</p>
